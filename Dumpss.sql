Polygamists face harsher punishments if they are convicted of other crimes such as domestic abuse or fraud under a new law signed late Tuesday night by Gov. Gary Herbert.\n\nHB99 passed by one vote in the final minutes of the 2017 Utah Legislature following several dramatic hearings on the topic and a protest rally where the family from the reality TV show \"Sister Wives\" and several hundred others spoke out against attempts that infringe on their rights to live plural marriages.\n\nJoe Darger, a Utah man who has three wives and helped organize the rally, said he and others are considering a legal challenge to a law that he says that only creates more fear among polygamists already wary of government officials.\n\n\"This is clearly unconstitutional. This clearly targets one group of people,\" Darger said. \"It\'s absurd that in this day and age that our speech, freedom of religion and ability to do what we want in our bedroom is being policed by the state of Utah.\"\n\nParker Douglas of the Utah Attorney General\'s Office said Wednesday the law doesn\'t change the office\'s long-standing policy to not prosecute otherwise law-abiding polygamists.\n\nDouglas said his office worked with legislators on revisions to the language that describes what a bigamy offense is to protect the state against future constitutional challenges after Kody Brown and his wives from the \"Sister Wives\" show sued over the constitutionality of Utah\'s unique polygamy law.\n\nThe Browns won in federal court, but the case was thrown out by appeals court judges who found the Browns couldn\'t sue because they were never prosecuted. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to take the Browns\' case.\n\nDouglas said his office didn\'t ask for the increased penalties, but he understands the thinking. It merely recognizes the historical evidence of such crimes being committed in some polygamous groups, such as Warren Jeffs\' sect on the Utah-Arizona border, he said.\n\nJeffs is serving a life sentence in Texas for sexually assaulting girls he considered brides. Eleven members of the group were charged last year with food stamp fraud and money laundering. Nine of them have taken plea deals, and one had his case dismissed.\n\n\"If there is somebody under the guise of a polygamous marriage or a sham polygamous community who are engaged in sex trafficking and human trafficking ? we think that\'s probably a higher-grade felony,\" Douglas said.\n\nThe law increased the maximum penalty from five to 15 years for polygamists who are also convicted of fraud, sex abuse, domestic abuse, human trafficking or human smuggling.\n\nThe law includes safe harbors for people leaving a polygamous marriage, reporting abuse or protecting a child.\n\nUtah\'s current polygamy law is already stricter than laws in other states because it bars married people from living with a second purported \"spiritual spouse\" even if the man is legally married to just one woman.\n\nThe new law changes the language to say that someone is breaking the law if they \"purport\" to be married to a second spouse and are living with that person. Before, prosecutors needed only to prove one or the other.\n\nDarger said he received numerous phone calls Wednesday from polygamists with questions.\n\n\"Are we purporting if we\'re on Facebook sharing our family photos?\" he asked \"This put a lot of questions in how we actually live our lives and claim who we are.\"\n\nThere are an estimated 30,000 polygamists in Utah. They believe polygamy brings exaltation in heaven ? a legacy of the early Mormon church. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints abandoned the practice in 1890 and now strictly forbids it.\n\nThe LDS Church didn\'t lobby for the bill but supported the premise.\n\n\"When it comes to laws governing polygamy, the church\'s primary interest is in looking after potential victims of such associations,\" church spokesman Eric Hawkins said in a statement. \"The church is concerned that reducing the perceived seriousness of this criminal activity sends the message that such abuses are not serious criminal offenses.\"\n\nDuring one of the debates about HB99, Rep. Mike Noel, R-Kanab, the bill\'s sponsor, and a Mormon, revealed that his great-grandfather was jailed for being a polygamist and said he\'s irritated that today\'s polygamists refer to themselves as Mormons.\n\n\"They\'ve hijacked my religion, and I actually resent that,\" Noel said in February.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n0 Pending Comments',NULL,NULL),(2,'http://www.sltrib.com/news/5108470-155/could-a-gov-romney-be-in','Salt Lake Tribune','2017-03-28 16:50:38.000000','2017-03-30 10:44:10.000000','Could a Gov.

He repeated his call from the opening day of the Legislature that the problem is a statewide one that has reached \"crisis\" proportions.\n\nIn his statement posted Tuesday on Twitter he said \"every community has a role to play,\" praising Draper leaders and adding that, \"I am willing to accept whatever locations are selected and remain committed [to] solving this crisis.\"\n\nSalt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams appears willing to overlook a key criteria for locating a new shelter if he chooses Draper: access to public transportation.\n\nThe Minuteman site is largely undeveloped and without a TRAX line. McAdams said a line is proposed for the area, and he suggested accelerating that work if the state chooses Draper for the new site.\n\n\"You can see it\'s a good site, it\'s not a perfect site,\" McAdams said, adding that having a city willing to host the center is valuable.\n\nWalker also has previously called for a new transit line through the prison property as part of redevelopment there, now just in the early planning stages.\n\nMcAdams said because of distance to the Draper sites from existing services in Salt Lake City, a center in Draper wouldn\'t house high-risk people.\n\n\"We believe this facility can work, it\'s just going to have to work for the right population and that population has lower needs,\" he said.\n\nGlenn Bailey, executive director of Crossroads Urban Center, a nonprofit group that offers services for low-income and homeless residents, said Draper\'s remoteness makes it a difficult choice for a shelter.\n\n\"The services will be miles away,\" he said. \"So the question would be if it will be well utilized and really meet the same kind of needs that the existing shelter does.\"\n\nCities and law enforcement officials consider single men a higher risk for crime and drug use, and residents from South Salt Lake and West Valley City feared the county was relocating the crime surrounding the Rio Grande district into their communities.\n\nNo decision has been made on which population ? single women, single men or families ? would be housed at which location, although a $4 million donation from businessman Pat King was accepted with assurances it would help fund a center for homeless women in the capital. Emails recently obtained by The Tribune also indicate a possible seasonal overflow site somewhere in the county to handle homeless residents.\n\nAdditionally, McAdams said in a March 8 email to staff that the county might look at changing an existing 300-bed Midvale shelter from housing families to single men. He has since backed away from that idea.\n\n\"That\'s something that we at a very cursory level considered,\" he said Tuesday. \"It\'s not something we considered now and I don\'t think\" picking Draper would lead Midvale to house single men instead of families.',NULL,NULL),(4,'http://www.sltrib.com/news/5101397-155/mcadams-homeless-leaders-plot-overflow-shelter','Salt Lake Tribune','2017-03-28 17:30:38.000000','2017-03-30 10:44:28.000000','McAdams, homeless leaders plot overflow shelter, closing St. Vincent de Paul Kitchen and using Midvale family shelter for single men','[u\'The Salt Lake Tribune\', u\'Matthew Piper\']','plot mcadams shelters city shelter men lake st county single vincent homeless using paul midvale salt overflow wrote','The current overflow shelter for Salt Lake City\'s homeless is across the street from the St. Vincent de Paul Kitchen, which has the primary responsibility of feeding homeless and low-income diners.\nThe facilities are owned by the Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City and operated by Catholic Community Services, which are included on the county\'s programming committee.\nReimherr told them the county was \"insisting\" that an additional seasonal overflow shelter \"outside of Salt Lake City\" be opened in time to shutter 210 S.

Among those matters: the demographics that will be served by each of three new shelters and an existing family shelter in Midvale, and the need to site an additional seasonal overflow shelter in an undetermined location.\n\nThe emails were all sent either to or from McAdams since Valentine\'s Day, when legislative leaders first told him that the county would need to site a shelter that had previously been contemplated for Salt Lake City.\n\n?\n\nWill there be a second siting sequel?\n\nIn a Feb. 27 email to the committee shaping the county\'s homeless service model, Director of Government Relations Patrick Reimherr reassured members about a newly announced commitment to close the emergency shelter at 210 S. Rio Grande St. by July 2019.\n\nWrote Reimherr: \"Salt Lake County and the property owner\" ? Shelter the Homeless Inc., a nonprofit that owns the Rio Grande and Midvale shelters and is expected to soon be granted ownership and governance of the three new shelters ? \"will not commit to such a decision without proof that supply is available to meet demand.\"\n\nThe words \"will not\" are bold and underlined.\n\nThe difference between the 1,100-bed capacity of the current shelter and the combined 600- to 700-bed capacity of three new ones has caused heartburn for some involved.\n\nReimherr told them the county was \"insisting\" that an additional seasonal overflow shelter \"outside of Salt Lake City\" be opened in time to shutter 210 S. Rio Grande St.\n\nThis shelter was included in a budget analysis prepared by the Department of Workforce Services and read by legislative leaders: $2 million in one-time costs and $350,000 ongoing for 66 seasonal beds. But it\'s scarcely been mentioned publicly.\n\nCrossroads Urban Center Associate Director Bill Tibbitts wrote Feb. 25 that \"[i]f the new plan includes an overflow shelter both myself and the press missed it.\"\n\nMcAdams responded that legislative leaders had wanted the announcement to focus on the three new resource centers but that he wouldn\'t support a changed direction without either a new overflow shelter or overflow availability at 210 S. Rio Grande St.\n\n\"That point is clear\" with legislators, he said. \"We will look for an opportunity to get that on the official record.\"\n\nFormer county employee Janell Fluckiger, having recently been installed as executive director of Shelter the Homeless, further responded that the nonprofit board \"will not allow homeless individuals to be steamrolled in the process of closing the Rio Grande facility.\"\n\nA few days earlier, Fluckiger wrote that the board ? which includes area business and political leaders, including McAdams and Department of Workforce Services Executive Director Jon Pierpont ? believed the state would take its turn by finding a place for the final, as-yet-unpublicized shelter.\n\n\"[S]iting shelters, especially a drunk tank overflow, is a political process that STH does not want to lead on,\" Fluckiger wrote.\n\nBut DWS Housing and Community Development Director Jonathan Hardy said Saturday that a dedicated overflow site may not be necessary given that the new shelters will have between 50 and 150 more beds than the original plan called for.\n\n\"If at all possible, I think we\'re going to try to avoid\" building an overflow shelter, Hardy said, explaining that motel vouchers or an add-on wing at one of the three new shelters could help meet unforeseen demand.\n\nBoth McAdams and Shaleane Gee, Salt Lake County\'s director of special projects and partnerships, said their understanding is still that the state will site an overflow shelter, though likely not at one of the seven sites he\'s weighting for a larger, more sophisticated facility.\n\nSaid Gee: \"If you don\'t have that somewhere in our services system, you are not being responsible.\"\n\n?\n\nWhat else happens on Rio Grande St.?\n\nThe current overflow shelter for Salt Lake City\'s homeless is across the street from the St. Vincent de Paul Kitchen, which has the primary responsibility of feeding homeless and low-income diners. On the same campus, the Weigand Homeless Resource Center provides a range of services to homeless people turned out of the emergency shelter for the day.\n\nOn March 2, Gee cautioned McAdams and county staff that they needed to be \"very, very prepared for reactions when folks learn that the proposal is not just that the shelter facility there is closing but that the plan also calls for Vinny\'s and Weigand to close.\"\n\n\"People are shocked to hear this,\" Gee continued. \"And even folks that want to see a change and the shelter go away start getting concerned when they hear that about what we are doing to the very vulnerable populations there.\"\n\nThat the mission might change for those two facilities has long been known. The new resource centers are expected to provide all-day services and meals, and the nearest one ? at 131 E. 700 South ? is 1.5 miles away from St. Vincent de Paul and Weigand.\n\nThe facilities are owned by the Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City and operated by Catholic Community Services, which are included on the county\'s programming committee.\n\nBut asked Friday if she had heard any talk of closure, Danielle Stamos, spokeswoman for Catholic Community Services, replied: \"Not a whisper.\"\n\n\"Our position is that we weren\'t aware of any plans and that we intend to continue serving our homeless clients right there where we are now,\" Stamos said.\n\nAt Monday\'s meeting of the Shelter the Homeless board, former Salt Lake County Mayor and president of the CCS board Peter Corroon said that between 400 and 500 area homeless people don\'t stay in those shelters and that CCS wants to continue to serve them.\n\nNobody objected.\n\nGee said Saturday that the county hasn\'t discussed closure of those facilities either internally or with the diocese.\n\nSaid McAdams on Friday: \"What we\'re saying there is if the [210 S. Rio Grande St.] shelter closes, that begs the question about what happens to the other resources. No decisions have been made.\"\n\nThat statement appears to contradict not only Gee\'s March 2 email but also a Feb. 22 email from Fluckiger, in which she wrote that CCS and the diocese \"is yet to be consulted about the repurposing of their budget, programs and property.\"\n\n\"This discussion needs to occur ASAP,\" she wrote to state and city officials.\n\n?\n\nWhich population goes where?\n\nIn December, businessman Pat King donated $4 million toward a women\'s shelter to honor his mother.\n\nOn Feb. 25, the day after city and county mayors joined legislative leaders to say that the plan had changed and that Salt Lake City would site two shelters, not four, King checked back in on plans for the Geraldine E. King Women\'s Resource Center.\n\n\"We will proceed with the single women\'s shelter as planned and the intention is that it be one of the two located in Salt Lake City,\" Gee wrote back.\n\nMeanwhile, Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski told media the city shelters would house single women and a gender-segregated population, implying Salt Lake County\'s shelter would house single men ? most frequently associated with the rampant lawbreaking on Rio Grande St.\n\nCounty and state officials have said the shelter populations will be decided only after all the sites are selected. But after Wednesday\'s public hearing on the county\'s proposed sites, McAdams raised the curious possibility that the proximity of the Jordan River to five of the county\'s seven sites might make them suited to a population of women and children.\n\nIf women are to be in Salt Lake City, and families are already housed at a 300-bed Shelter the Homeless facility in Midvale, what did he mean? A March 8 email from McAdams raises a new possibility.\n\nPitching a possible shelter site, he wrote: \"If this site were to go forward, I would envision it as a family site and use Midvale for single men.\"\n\nThe Midvale site\'s proximity to a rail yard led Mayor JoAnn Seghini to say last month that it was a \"terrible location\" for its population and to express her hope that it will move after a four-year sunset clause in legislation that overrides her city\'s policy and keeps it open year-round.\n\nMcAdams said state law would need to be changed if the Midvale shelter were to serve single men instead of families and that \"that\'s not something that we\'ve spent a lot of time looking at.\"\n\nStill, he allowed: \"We\'ve thought about if that\'s something that we could explore,\"\n\nGee said that homeless children are the model\'s top priority and that the Midvale shelter has been specifically tailored to work for families. The seven sites proposed by the county, she said, \"are very specifically for single adults.\"\n\n?\n\nDid McAdams set his own deadline? No.\n\nMcAdams vowed to provide a \"robust yet abbreviated\" public process, eschewing the behind-closed-doors site selection tactics of Salt Lake City leaders and listening firsthand to more than eight hours of comment during a hastily arranged input schedule.\n\nOne of the most frequent complaints he heard: that there was no public process. Of those who acknowledged that they were, in fact, part of a public process, many said the whole thing was a sham production.\n\nAt Wednesday\'s hearing, Sen. Daniel Thatcher, R-West Valley, roamed the halls and stoked the flames, telling people that McAdams had written the bill and proposed the March 30 date to legislators, who couldn\'t have cared less about a deadline.\n\nEmails don\'t support those claims.\n\nThere was robust discussion of which format to have. A town hall would be unproductive, but an open house wouldn\'t satisfy those who wanted to speak publicly. McAdams favored a hybrid of the two because, \"It feels like we might get more qualitative input on the sites,\" he wrote to his team.\n\nAs to whether McAdams wrote the bill and wanted an early deadline, Gee wrote Feb. 17 that House Speaker Greg Hughes and Majority Whip Francis Gibson called on the county, as a condition of $20 million in state funding for the shelters, to open and shut its public process within a week of the Feb. 24 announcement.\n\nMcAdams has said he asked for an extension and settled on March 30.\n\nHe wrote to staff after Gee\'s Feb. 17 email that the process was \"not ideal, but it is the timeline dictated to us by the speaker.\"\n\n\"I know I\'m asking a lot from all of you,\" he wrote to his team. \"We have an incredible opportunity to get significant state funding that will measurably improve the lives of thousands of people in crisis.\"\n\nAn email from Gee the next day indicates DWS staff, not the county, were helping Gibson draft the bill, which would ultimately deprive city officials of their power to reject the county shelter.\n\nmpiper@sltrib.com\n\nTwitter: @matthew_piper',NULL,NULL),(5,'http://www.sltrib.com/news/5115755-155/utahns-give-herbert-high-marks-only','Salt Lake Tribune','2017-03-30 07:49:38.000000','2017-03-30 10:44:32.000000','Utahns give Herbert high marks; only Republicans and \'very active\' Mormons approve of Legislature','[u\'The Salt Lake Tribune\', u\'Lee Davidson\']','legislature high good republicans herbert mormons performance state passed utahns active marks poll approve legislatures gave','Gary Herbert is now enjoying sky-high approval ratings — but the only groups of Utahns who applaud the Legislature\'s performance highly are Republicans and \"very active\" Mormons.\nPoll » More than 70% of Utahns approve of Herbert’s performance; Legislature’s fans are GOP, active LDS.\n\"Sixty-three percent of the bills passed in the Legislature passed unanimously,\" he said.\nAll others — Catholics, Protestants, \"somewhat active\" and \"not active\" Mormons and others — gave the Legislature a thumbs down by three-to-one margins or more.\nOnly one of the religious categories in the poll — very active Mormons — gave the Legislature an overall positive rating, by a 63-36 margin.','Poll ? More than 70% of Utahns approve of Herbert?s performance; Legislature?s fans are GOP, active LDS.\n\nGov. Gary Herbert is now enjoying sky-high approval ratings ? but the only groups of Utahns who applaud the Legislature\'s performance highly are Republicans and \"very active\" Mormons.\n\nA new poll by The Salt Lake Tribune and the Hinckley Institute of Politics shows that Herbert\'s performance is strongly or somewhat approved by 71 percent of Utahns, while 26 percent somewhat or strongly disapprove, with 3 percent undecided.\n\nThat is up significantly from 15 months ago. A similar poll in January 2016 showed a 55-27 positive margin for Herbert, with 18 percent then undecided.\n\nMeanwhile, the new poll shows that 46 percent of Utahns rate the Legislature\'s performance as excellent or good, while 52 percent said it was fair or poor. It was down slightly from a 49-49 split before the Legislature convened in January. Republicans approved of the Legislature\'s performance 65 percent to 34 percent. Just 15 percent of Democrats and 35 percent of independent voters gave the Legislature high marks. Only one of the religious categories in the poll ? very active Mormons ? gave the Legislature an overall positive rating, by a 63-36 margin. All others ? Catholics, Protestants, \"somewhat active\" and \"not active\" Mormons and others ? gave the Legislature a thumbs down by three-to-one margins or more. House Speaker Greg Hughes, R-Draper, says that may show disdain for the Legislature\'s passage of a HB155 to make Utah\'s drunken driving laws the toughest in the nation, and publicity about other alcohol reform passed this year. \"People who drink responsibly, and it doesn\'t contradict their religion\" likely \"looked at the legislation and thought there was a lack of perception of reality,\" Hughes said. He has spoken out against the new law to lower the blood-alcohol content to be considered drunk while driving from 0.08 to 0.05. About 60 percent of Utahns are LDS, while 88 percent of legislators are.\n\nHughes has praised Herbert\'s call for study this summer about possible unintended consequences of that new law, to be followed by a special session of the Legislature to fix problems well in advance of its Dec. 30, 2018, effective date.\n\nHughes noted that the poll had finished its surveying before Herbert signed HB155 on March 23 ? and he wonders if the governor\'s numbers might actually be lower now because of his support of it. The statewide poll of 605 registered Utah voters was conducted March 15-21 by Dan Jones & Associates, and has a margin of error of 3.98 percent.\n\nAs reported earlier, that same poll also found that the only religious category that gave majority support for the new DUI bill was \"very active\" Mormons.\n\nHerbert said he is thrilled with his high numbers, but said they mostly reflect that the state is doing well.\n\n\"I think it is indicative of the fact that the state continues to have great success economically,\" with a strong quality of life, he said.\n\n\"People are satisfied and feel good about the future of Utah and the progress we\'ve made, and are optimistic that we are going to continue to excel,\" he said. \"I\'m just a reflection of that. The governor must be doing a good job because the state is doing a good job.\"\n\nHerbert said he\'s especially humbled by his high numbers because \"in politics, friends come and go ? but enemies accumulate.\"\n\nHe has also praised the Legislature for working toward consensus on tough issues. \"Sixty-three percent of the bills passed in the Legislature passed unanimously,\" he said. \"Eighty-eight percent of the bills passed with over 85 percent of the vote? It shows an overwhelming consensus being developed in our Legislature.\"\n\nRepublicans maintain supermajorities in both chambers ? controlling the House 62-13 and the Senate 24-5.\n\nSenate President Wayne Niederhauser, R-Sandy, said he expects legislatures always have lower favorability ratings than governors.\n\n\"The Legislature has to address any issue that\'s brought before it,\" and can\'t choose just the popular ones. \"In one way or another, we\'re affecting somebody out there negatively in all those bills.\"\n\nThe governor, meanwhile, \"is a committee of one. Yes, he has to address the issues we send him. But he\'s not the one debating like we are at the Legislature,\" Niederhauser said.',NULL,NULL),(6,'https://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/12796-the-political-risks-and-rewards-from-a-homeless-shelter-in-drap','Utah Policy','2017-03-30 10:43:38.000000','2017-03-30 10:44:37.000000','The political risks and rewards from a homeless shelter in Draper','[u\'Contributing Editor\', u\'Bob Bernick\']','city rewards draper shelter house mcadams political sites lake risks homeless valley salt','The deteriorating conditions around Salt Lake City’s Pioneer Park and the Rio Grande area had always been Salt Lake City problems – if you will, Democratic problems.\nThe political risks and rewards from a homeless shelter in DraperFirst came the surprise press conference during the 2017 Legislature where Salt Lake County agreed to take at least one homeless center, then Monday another surprise presser where Draper City officials said they would consider taking that shelter.\nThe political heat from homeless centers in West Valley City and South Salt Lake could fall into Utah House politics, as well.\nAnd to favor two homeless sites in his city is already providing him political trouble.\nSo to get a city (Draper) to offer two sites is politically remarkable – just consider what Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski went through in her original four-site suggestion.','The political risks and rewards from a homeless shelter in Draper\n\nFirst came the surprise press conference during the 2017 Legislature where Salt Lake County agreed to take at least one homeless center, then Monday another surprise presser where Draper City officials said they would consider taking that shelter.\n\nUtahPolicy likes to explain the politics of difficult public decisions, and so we look at the latest homeless siting revelations, and the political implications:\n\nAs Mel Brooks said in one of his comedic films: ?It is nice to be king.?\n\nAnd while Democratic County Mayor Ben McAdams will make the final decision on where to site the homeless center outside of Salt Lake City and Midvale, making him one of the kings on this difficult homeless issue, the other clearly is state House Speaker Greg Hughes.\n\nHughes represents House District 51 in, you guessed it, Draper.\n\nAnd, sources say, he spent much of last weekend driving around his city with local officials, including Draper Mayor Troy Walker, looking at possible homeless center sites.\n\nAnd if Hughes has been asking local officials to step up and help out in Utah?s homeless efforts, then his town should be included.\n\nBut both Hughes and Walker are taking political risks with their homeless advocacy.\n\nDraper City offered two sites: One on the current state prison location, another east of I-80 on land near the large Geneva Rock quarry property.\n\nMcAdams has already identified several possible sites in West Valley City and South Salt Lake City ? and officials from both entities are complaining loudly.\n\nSo to get a city Draper to offer two sites is politically remarkable ? just consider what Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski went through in her original four-site suggestion.\n\nHughes wasn?t at Monday?s press conference. But his fingerprints were all over it.\n\nWalker is up for re-election this year. And to favor two homeless sites in his city is already providing him political trouble.\n\nThe filing deadline for Draper mayor is not for months yet, and, sources tell UtahPolicy, Walker has already received blowback, with some folks saying they will run against him, others saying they will raise money for folks who run against him.\n\nHughes has far-reaching political hands, and you can wager he has promised to help Walker in fundraising and other campaign aid.\n\nThe political heat from homeless centers in West Valley City and South Salt Lake could fall into Utah House politics, as well.\n\nSeveral of the more vulnerable GOP House seats are in West Valley City ? with former GOP Rep. Johnny Anderson?s seat going to Democrat Karen Kwan in the 2016 election.\n\nThe whole Murray/Taylorsville/West Valley City area House districts were roiling in recent elections ? several House Republicans actually behind on Election Night, pulling off victories only after canvasing vote-counting.\n\nCould a Draper site help some of those struggling GOP House members?\n\nWhile Hughes is safe in his District 51, Rep. LaVatr Christensen, R-Draper, won re-election by five votes last November.\n\nSo there is a lot of political risk in Hughes/Walker et al. stepping up into the homeless battles now happening.\n\nIt has not gone unnoticed that McAdams? selections of five possible homeless center sites outside of Salt Lake City made before Draper?s offers are not in the heart of the 4th Congressional District.\n\nDemocratic countywide officeholders have long looked at the major U.S. House seat in Salt Lake County for a possible run ? since they already have proven they can win in parts of the county.\n\nThere will be the 2018 and 2020 4th District races with incumbent Rep. Mia Love, a Republican from Utah County for popular Democrats, like McAdams, to take a hard look at before the GOP-controlled Utah Legislature redraws U.S. House seats in 2021.\n\nSo far, few could argue that McAdams or Hughes have been overtly playing politics with the homeless issue ? although upset officials in West Valley City and South Salt Lake may disagree.\n\nHughes became the driving state force a year ago when few legislators were talking about the homeless being a state issue.\n\nThe deteriorating conditions around Salt Lake City?s Pioneer Park and the Rio Grande area had always been Salt Lake City problems ? if you will, Democratic problems.\n\nFirst, the Hughes/McAdams coalition bailed out Biskupski ? dropping four city sites to two.\n\nNow Hughes/Draper seems to be at least offering a bailout to McAdams ? although the two Draper sites are not as ideal as what McAdams has suggested already in West Valley City and South Salt Lake.\n\nIf push comes to shove, the state ? which doesn?t have to abide by local zoning ordinances ? can step in and pick the final homeless site in Salt Lake County.\n\nBut Hughes reportedly doesn?t want to do that ? the city and county must continue making major contributions to the homeless settlement ? as they have been -- UtahPolicy is told.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.',NULL,NULL),(7,'http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/12793-legal-analysis-argues-trump-could-revoke-bears-ears','Utah Policy','2017-03-29 10:43:38.000000','2017-03-30 10:44:39.000000','Legal analysis argues Trump could revoke Bears Ears','[u\'Managing Editor\', u\'Bryan Schott\']','revoke trump monuments bears national legal argues analysis monument president size ears','Legal analysis argues Trump could revoke Bears EarsA new legal analysis concludes that President Trump could undo the Bears Ears National Monument.\nThe analysis from the Pacific Legal Foundation finds that a president can revoke a national monument if they determine the areas under protection are \"illegally large.\"\nThe Utah Legislature rushed through a pair of resolutions calling on President Trump to undo the Bears Ears National Monument and reduce the size of Grand Staircase-Escalante.\nNo president has ever overturned a national monument, but they have reduced their size on occasion.\nFrom E&E News:Yoo and Gaziano argue, however, that even if a president does not have a \"general discretionary revocation power,\" Trump could seek to revoke monuments by declaring them overly large.','Legal analysis argues Trump could revoke Bears Ears\n\nA new legal analysis concludes that President Trump could undo the Bears Ears National Monument.\n\nThe analysis from the Pacific Legal Foundation finds that a president can revoke a national monument if they determine the areas under protection are \"illegally large.\" The analysis was conducted by Todd Gaziano and John Yoo.\n\nFrom E&E News:\n\nYoo and Gaziano argue, however, that even if a president does not have a \"general discretionary revocation power,\" Trump could seek to revoke monuments by declaring them overly large. \"The Congress that enacted the Antiquities Act did not intend monuments of that size to be established by presidential designation,\" the pair wrote, asserting that early monuments tended to be 5,000 acres or less. They later added: \"If a president makes a credible determination, based on the facts and a reasonable interpretation of the act, that some former monuments are illegally large relative to the original \'object\' supposedly being protected, he could declare that the initial designation was void, especially if there is no easy way to make it lawful by severing discrete parcels of land.\"\n\nNo president has ever overturned a national monument, but they have reduced their size on occasion.\n\nThe Utah Legislature rushed through a pair of resolutions calling on President Trump to undo the Bears Ears National Monument and reduce the size of Grand Staircase-Escalante.

The several hundred people who filled the auditorium, however, were dead serious in their angry opposition to Stewart\'s stances on everything from Bears Ears to President Donald Trump\'s proposed border wall.\n\nDiscontented constituents also demanded answers about holding Trump accountable for various controversies that have plagued his administration in its infancy. There were chants of \"do your job\" both during and after the meeting.\n\nReceiving what seemed to be the most thunderous applause of the night, one man said he believed Trump\'s ties to the Russian government were \"criminal and possibly treasonous.\"\n\nThe man also criticized the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, saying that its chairman, California Rep.

Even so, he said, he regrets sending it on a government email account.\n\nWasatch County Attorney Scott Sweat said the email was not authorized by his office and does not reflect the county attorney\'s position. Sweat did, however, formally oppose the bill.\n\n\"We want the best outcome we can for victims of crime and for the people of Utah,\" he said. \"We want to work with legislators to get the best law we can.\"\n\n?\n\nBridge to nowhere ? In all its bureaucratic beauty, the Utah Department of Transportation figured out its own way to build a bridge for no particular reason, spending just under $1 million on a structure that no longer exists.\n\nAs UDOT made plans to widen the South Jordan Parkway about 15 years ago, it entered into an agreement with South Jordan to build a pedestrian bridge over 10600 South for students at South Jordan Elementary School, which was near 10600 South and 1300 West.\n\nAfter all the environmental assessments were completed and the budget approved, the city advised UDOT that the school was about to be closed and a new one was being built several blocks away on 1300 West, so the bridge was unnecessary, according to City Engineer Brad Klavano.',NULL,NULL),(10,'http://www.sltrib.com/news/5071536-155/do-your-job-crowd-boos-border','Salt Lake Tribune','2017-04-01 09:11:02.000000','2017-04-01 09:33:02.000000','\'Do your job\': Crowd boos border wall, health overhaul at Rep.

Each person walked to a microphone at the front of the room and railed at Stewart. Just one man used his time to thank the representative.\n\nThe attendees drowned out Stewart the most, though, while he addressed two questions on Russia and the Trump administration ? topics he weighs in on as a member of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\"Can you name one thing you\'ve done in the [past] 60 to 80 days to hold this administration accountable?\" one man asked.\n\n\"You and I are not going to see the world the same,\" Stewart responded before the crowd shouted over him. He stood at the podium and continued to talk. The speakers carried pieces of his speech over the noise, with fragmented notes about classified information and continuing to investigate alleged wrongdoings by the president.\n\n\"We\'ll pursue this and see where we end up,\" he finished.\n\nHe had a nearly identical answer for probing supposed collusion between Russia and Trump\'s team to sway the 2016 election, suggesting that there is \"no evidence\" that the president or his staff were involved in a case of foreign meddling.\n\n\"What about Michael Flynn?\" the audience yelled.\n\n\"We\'ll continue to investigate,\" Stewart said. \"You can\'t have something like this happen and not realize that it will eventually come out.\"\n\nStewart has been quiet about recent revelations that Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes received reports from White House officials that showed Donald Trump\'s campaign was incidentally swept up in the surveillance of foreign nationals by U.S. spy agencies.\n\nNunes talked about the findings with the president, leading many to accuse the congressman of eagerly doing the bidding of the administration rather than conducting an independent congressional review. Utah\'s Rep. Jason Chaffetz has defended Nunes, calling him a man of \"high integrity.\"\n\nOne man in the audience, though, held a sign that said \"Nunes ? neutral.\" Ann Johnson, of Bountiful, gripped a poster that said \"Repeal and replace Congress.\"\n\n\"Nunes seems to be carrying information to the White House when that\'s who he\'s supposed to be investigating,\" the 75-year-old Republican said.\n\nFriday\'s town hall was the first to be held in person by a member of Utah\'s all-Republican congressional delegation since Chaffetz\'s rowdy February event in which 1,000 people were allowed inside. Another 1,500 stood outside ? barred from entering because of fire codes. Those who didn\'t make it into the auditorium rallied and chanted while those inside shouted over Chaffetz, urging him to \"explain yourself.\"\n\nAfter that, Utah Republican Party Chairman James Evans said the event was \"violent\" and unsafe; he warned representatives to skip in-person forums ? an assessment not shared by police, nor by Chaffetz. Evans attended Stewart\'s town hall Friday and said it, too, was hostile and harassing.\n\n\"I think it was more disrespectful than anything,\" he said.\n\nUnlike Chaffetz\'s event, though, no one was kept out of Stewart\'s. About 200 people were temporarily held outside as the minutes ticked down to the 7 p.m. start time. The congressman walked out and said, \"I\'m sorry. We\'re trying to get everyone in.\" And by five minutes into the event, those remaining behind the doors squeezed into the auditorium.\n\nPolice turned away 12 people who showed up more than 45 minutes after the event started. People had arrived for the town hall as early as 3 p.m.\n\nSen. Jim Dabakis stood at the front of the line, handing out fake Russian currency, telling people they were \"now paid operatives\" ? riffing on a comment Chaffetz made and later walked back that the attendees at his town hall were paid protesters.\n\nMore than half of the audience was made up of members of the state\'s growing \"resistance\" movements. Stewart gave the first question to Courtney Marden, founder of Utah Indivisible.\n\n\"How could you have supported a bill that takes health care away from so many people that voted for you in good faith?\" she asked.\n\n\"We\'re trying to make it better for you,\" Stewart said as boos erupted. \"You guys should be happy, then ? you have Obamacare.\"\n\nStewart, Utah\'s lone unequivocal supporter of the GOP bill to replace Obamacare, was discouraged when the measure was pulled last week.\n\nHe had postponed his town hall ? slated for March 24 ? to vote \"yes\" on the bill to shift control of Medicaid back to the states and remove the tax fine for not having insurance.\n\nAn estimated 24 million fewer people were to have health coverage under the plan, though Stewart said Friday that that number represents \"those who chose\" not have insurance.\n\nMarden, a nurse, commended the congressman for \"the bravery\" of standing onstage and facing the criticism head on.\n\n\"We\'re trying to be as civil as possible,\" she said. Utah Indivisible compiled questions to ask the congressman and printed information packets on his voting record.\n\n\"Stewart flies under the radar,\" Marden added. \"That\'s what he does.\"\n\nThree of the questions asked during the event focused on Bears Ears National Monument and federal lands, which Stewart says he wants more state control of.\n\n\"I think there\'s this assumption that if you\'re Republican you hate the environment,\" he said. \"I have to tell you I think that\'s a silly place to start an argument.\"\n\nAs Stewart ended the town hall and slipped behind the stage\'s red curtains, the crowd roared in anger.

Gary Herbert last week. Utah became the first state in the nation to lower the DUI threshold to .05%.\n\nHerbert was the subject of an intense lobbying effort by opponents of the bill, including local restaurateurs and tourism officials who argued it would harm business and tourism.\n\nThe measure won\'t go into effect for 18 months as lawmakers will study the issue for the next several months. Gov. Herbert intends to call a special session this summer to address any possible changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpponents of lowering the DUI level painted the issue as a religious one, arguing that it was a done to favor the LDS Church, Utah\'s dominant religion which eschews alcohol consumption.\n\nOur survey found that only Mormons who describe themselves as \"very active\" were for the new regulations, while nearly every other religious demographic is opposed.\n\n- \"Very active\" Mormons support the legislation 66-29%.\n\n- \"Somewhat active\" members of the LDS Church are nearly evenly split on lowering the DUI level with 47% in favor and 48% opposed.\n\n- \"Not active\" members of the LDS Church overwhelmingly oppose the lower BAC level 73-25%.\n\n- Catholics oppose the lower DUI level 84-16%.\n\n- Protestants are against the lower threshold 79-21%.\n\n- Those with no religious beliefs are against the lower level 89-9%.\n\nBackers of the new regulation say it will improve safety on Utah\'s roads.

Utah Sens. Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee continue to tout U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch as the Senate gears up for a contentious political battle over the federal appellate judge\'s confirmation.\n\nHatch and Lee sided with majority Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee in the 11-9 vote Monday to send the nomination to the full Senate.\n\nThe vote sets the stage for a showdown likely Friday in which Gorsuch\'s confirmation isn\'t really in doubt. But it could have a long-lasting impact on the high court and the Senate.\n\nRepublicans denied President Barack Obama\'s nominee, Merrick Garland, a hearing last year. Democrats intend to filibuster to block the vote on Gorsuch, a move Hatch called \"abysmal.\" The GOP, which holds a 52-48 majority, has vowed to change the Senate rules if necessary to get him through.\n\n\"The choice we face is between impartial or political judges, between judges who follow the law or those who attempt to control the law,\" Hatch told the committee.\n\nHe called Gorsuch a \"superb\" nominee who would be impartial, fair and open-minded.\n\nLee said he wonders how a judge who \"many are decrying as so wildly out of the mainstream\" could see 2,700 cases in his time on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and rule unanimously with his colleagues 97 percent of the time and in the majority 99 percent of the time.\n\n\"That is not the background of a judge who is not in the mainstream,\" Lee said.\n\nDuring Monday\'s hearing, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., criticized Gorsuch\'s answers as \"excruciatingly evasive.\" Leahy said he did nothing to allay fears that the judge would bring a partisan agenda to the high court. Leahy said Gorsuch shares an \"anti-choice, anti-environment, pro-corporate\" agenda with the far right.\n\nLeahy said a GOP move to end filibusters of Supreme Court nominees would hurt the Senate but argued that he has to vote his conscience, even if it causes Republicans to change the rules.\n\n\"I cannot vote solely to protect an institution when the rights of hardworking Americans are at risk because I fear that the Senate I would be defending no longer exists,\" he said.\n\nThree Democrats have already signaled they plan to vote for Gorsuch, giving him 55 of the 60 votes needed for confirmation.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has left the door open to invoking the \"nuclear option\" to change the Senate rules to require a simple majority of 51 votes to confirm a Supreme Court nominee if the Democrats filibuster.\n\nBoyd Matheson, president of the Sutherland Institute, said he expects things to get \"hot and heavy\" in the days leading to the Senate vote because outside groups on both sides will raise millions of dollars to target specific senators.\n\n\"The left will do a fundraising campaign saying that if we allow Gorsuch to go through, it\'s the end of the republic as we know it.

Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who has long been a protector of Senate traditions, said he would support a rule change for high court nominations, arguing that it was the only way to overcome political gamesmanship with judicial appointments.\n\n\"If you\'re willing to block someone as qualified as Judge Gorsuch, you\'ll block anyone,\" Hatch told reporters after the committee voted 11-9 to move the nomination forward.\n\nThe Senate is expected to vote Friday to confirm Gorsuch, who would fill the vacancy left after the Feb. 13, 2016, death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia. President Barack Obama early last year had picked Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the D.C. Court of Appeals, to take Scalia\'s place but Republicans steadfastly refused to hold hearings on his nomination. They argued that such a decision should not be made in a presidential election year.\n\nThat move, paired with Democrats\' concerns about how Gorsuch would rule on high-profile issues such as abortion and money in politics, leaves this week\'s confirmation battle largely split on party lines. Only three Democratic senators have said they would vote for Gorsuch.\n\n\"Despite his impressive academic credentials, Judge Gorsuch\'s record and evasive responses ? even refusing to answer questions regarding his views of cases like Roe v. Wade and Citizens United ? do not give me confidence that he possesses a judicial philosophy that will serve the American public well,\" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said Monday.\n\n\"Unless we were asking about fishing or basketball, Judge Gorsuch stonewalled and avoided any substantive response,\" added Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe Senate has never required a 60-vote threshold to advance a Supreme Court nominee to a final vote because bipartisan compromises have negated the need in recent situations. This time, however, Democrats are likely to invoke the rule. The GOP, which holds 52 seats, can remove that rule with a simple majority.\n\n\"We will not have a successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee because if we have to, we will change the rules,\" said Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., adding that he would \"hate that\" but that it would be necessary.\n\nThe White House said Monday it would back the move to remove the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees.\n\nHatch, who was one of Gorsuch\'s biggest cheerleaders during the Judiciary Committee\'s confirmation hearings, said ending the requirement for a 60-vote hurdle is needed to thwart a left-wing effort to defeat Trump\'s nominee.\n\n\"All I can say is, we can\'t let them just stop one of the best nominees ever nominated to the Supreme Court because their far-left constituencies are screaming and shouting,\" Hatch told CNN on Monday, referring to Senate Democrats. \"They can\'t seem to do that and don\'t seem to have the courage to do that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Hatch bristled at the suggestion that it was unfair to push forward Gorsuch\'s nomination even though he and other Senate Republicans had blocked Obama\'s nominee for months.\n\n\"I\'ll just tell you straight up, that\'s total BS,\" Hatch told CNN\'s John Berman, who pressed on whether there was a double standard with Republicans wanting to confirm a GOP pick but not a Democratic one. \"I can\'t go back in time and show you any case where in a presidential election year they allowed a Supreme Court justice to be nominated unless both sides agreed. And both sides didn\'t agree.\"\n\nSen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican who as a private lawyer had argued before Gorsuch at the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, also defended Gorsuch, saying that while Democrats may want him to promise to rule in certain ways, that\'s not how the judiciary should work.\n\nLee also said that Gorsuch is someone who rules on the law, but doesn\'t make law; and he added that the nominee isn\'t anyone\'s puppet.\n\n\"There has been a suggestion, sometimes it\'s been implicit, other times it\'s been very explicit, that Judge Gorsuch is beholden somehow to individuals that have expressed support for him,\" Lee said. \"This is a very, very serious claim.

Two Florida men accused of installing a card skimming device at a gas pump were arrested thanks to an alert police officer.\n\nBut the men were released from the Salt Lake County Jail five hours later due to overcrowding issues, and now police don\'t believe they\'ll ever find them again.\n\n\"They were trying to install a card skimmer. And I guess they\'ve been flying around and doing it all over the country. And before our detectives could call Monday morning to retain them at the jail, the jail had already released them. Now they\'re in the wind,\" said Cottonwood Heights Police Sgt. Ryan Shosted.\n\nSalt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder said he will own up to mistakes when they are made. But in this case, he said his jail did nothing wrong.\n\n\"To blame the jail now when they got out, and all police tell us when they arrive is, \'Here\'s a third-degree felony for fraud,\' what are we supposed to do?? Winder said.\n\nJust before 4 a.m. Sunday, a Cottonwood Heights police officer noticed a U-Haul van and an SUV at the same pump at a Shell Gas Station, 1344 E. Fort Union Blvd. The driver of each vehicle was acting suspiciously, standing very close to the pump, Shosted said. Then the officer noticed one of the vehicles was parked so its gas tank was on the opposite side of the pump.\n\n\"After several minutes, neither were putting gas in their car, so he knew they were up to something,\" Shosted said.\n\nThe officer approached the men, noticed a screwdriver on one of the seats, and arrested them. One of the men resisted as the officer put handcuffs on him, according to Shosted.\n\nAriel Alejandro Alpizar Gonzalez, 22, of Orlando, Florida, and Alayn Espinosa-Lopez, 24, of Kissimmee, Florida, were booked into the Salt Lake County Jail for investigation of obtaining encoded information on a financial card, and criminal mischief. Espinosa-Lopez was also arrested for investigation of interfering with an arrest.\n\nThe men are currently on probation out of Florida for doing the same thing there, Shosted said. One of them had just flown into Utah from Florida and rented the truck, he said. Investigators believe the two were in Utah specifically to install card skimming devices on several gas pumps, and tried to use the large vehicles to hide their activity.\n\nInside their vehicles, detectives seized a laptop, multiple cellphones and a card skimming machine, according to a Salt Lake County Jail report.\n\nCard skimming devices read the magnetic strip on a person\'s bank card. So whenever a person uses a debit or credit card to pay for gas, a machine will read their card information, transmit it back to the owners of the device, who then typically sell that credit card information to another person.\n\nThe people who install card skimmers are rarely caught, Shosted said, but their actions affect thousands of people locally from all walks of life.\n\n\"When they put these skimmers in, think about how many people fill up gas, how many people that cycle through a gas station. And these suspects are just driving around to every gas station installing these devices. Think about how bad this messes up somebody\'s life. It takes away people\'s house payment, it takes away utility payments, it takes away food for their children. Everybody buys gas,\" Shosted said.\n\n\"It\'s kind of frustrating because you don\'t catch people like this.\"\n\nCottonwood Heights Police Chief Robby Russo was critical Tuesday of the release of the two men, blaming the recently enacted new booking policy at the Salt Lake County Jail.\n\n\"Sheriff Winder cannot stand up and pound the pulpit at the U.S. Attorney\'s Office and talk about how important these identity theft and fraud cases are and how they jeopardize people\'s finances and lives, and then turn around and release somebody from jail who has accumulated thousands of names and personal account information before ICE has a chance to put a detainer on them because they\'re here illegally,\" Russo said.\n\nWinder said Tuesday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was, in fact, notified. He also noted that no one at the jail received a heads up about making a special hold on the two arrested men. Winder said when Rep. Jason Chaffetz held his town hall meeting at Brighton High School, Cottonwood Heights police asked ahead of time for a blanket override of the booking policies for that evening.\n\n\"That should suggest that Cottonwood Heights knows very well how to override our restrictions,? Winder said. \"Chief Russo ought not complain about a process that he and his agency have used to their advantage very recently to great success.\"\n\nWinder said he takes a strong stance against identity theft, as the press conference suggested, and isn\'t interested in getting into a public war of words over the issue.\n\n\"It was a simple booking. The same as any third-degree felony card skimming that we would do. So we have no way to know that there is any other issues Cottonwood Heights is concerned about, or any other agency,? he said.\n\nIn February, Winder, along with several other state and local law enforcers, stood beside U.S. Attorney for Utah John Huber at a press conference announcing that a federal grand jury had returned a 56-count indictment against eight people, with the charges ranging from conspiracy to commit bank fraud to identity theft to drugs.\n\nA year ago, Winder enacted a new policy at the jail in an effort to relieve overcrowding issues. The plan has different phases depending on the current population. One phase doesn\'t allow jail officers to book those arrested for class A misdemeanor crimes, with the exception of DUI, domestic violence crimes, child abuse, violation of a protective order or any crime that would put them on the sex/kidnapping offender registry of convicted.\n\nCottonwood Heights believe the two men have already fled the state.\n\nShosted reminded residents that if they see something at a gas pump that appears suspicious, say something.\n\n\"If they pull up to gas pump and it looks like its been altered, don\'t be afraid to ask an attendant to take a look at it,\" he said.',NULL,NULL),(17,'http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865677084/Got-power-New-Rocky-Mountain-Power-plan-includes-more-wind-more-solar-new-transmission-line.html','Deseret News','2017-04-04 10:56:29.000000','2017-04-04 03:56:39.000000','Got power?

A $3.5 billion plan that serves as a 20-year blueprint for meeting power generation needs in Utah and five other states in the West envisions a new transmission line to carry Wyoming wind and building 1,040 megawatts of solar capacity, with the majority of that in Utah.\n\nRocky Mountain Power unveiled its 2017 Integrated Resource Plan on Tuesday following a public planning process that began nearly a year ago.\n\nThe plan has been filed with utility regulators and is designed to provide reliable electric service at the lowest cost possible, according to company officials.\n\n\"This plan provides more diversity in the energy we use, which helps us keep electricity prices low for customers and improves the economies of our states,\" said Cindy Crane, president and chief executive officer of Rocky Mountain Power.\n\n\"The proposal is a major investment that will produce more jobs, provide a stronger tax base and build transmission lines that will deliver reliable energy for years to come,\" Crane said.\n\nThe plan includes:\n\n? Upgrading more than 900 megawatts of existing wind turbines with larger blades and new technology that will increase energy production anywhere from 14 percent to 32 percent.\n\n? Beginning construction on the Gateway West 500-kilovolt transmission line from Medicine Bow, Wyoming, and the Jim Bridger Power Plant in southwest Wyoming to enable additional wind generation. The new power line is expected to be in service by 2020.\n\n? Building up to 1,040 megawatts of new solar between 2028 and 2036, with 77 percent of that power intended for construction in Utah.\n\nThe plan includes an emphasis on continued improvements in energy efficiency, which Rocky Mountain Power anticipates will meet 88 percent of energy growth needs over the next decade ? a jump of 2 percent from the forecast in 2015.\n\nThe company took advantage of production tax credits in December 2016 to repower existing wind facilities with the latest technology, including longer blades.\n\nUnder the plan, the repowered wind facilities will produce more zero-emission energy for a longer period of time and at reduced operating costs.\n\nDuring the next two decades, Rocky Mountain Power\'s parent company, PacifiCorp, anticipates the retirement of 3,650 megawatts of existing coal capacity, including a Wyoming unit at Naughton set to idle by the end of 2018.\n\nThe decision to retire, however, comes as the utility evaluates emerging technologies that could extend the life of the coal-fired power unit if it can be proven to be cost-effective for ratepayers.\n\nOther long-range retirements of coal-fired electrical generation include two units at the Huntington Power Plant in Emery County, which could be closed by the end of 2036, though the plan stresses the commitments for retirement are not firm.\n\nThe plan does not anticipate adding selective catalytic reduction equipment to two Utah power plants, which the company says would add hundreds of millions of costs to customers\' power bills.\n\nThe emissions reductions equipment has been a source of controversy regarding Utah\'s compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency\'s regional haze rule at the Hunter and Huntington power plants.\n\nEnvironmental groups have sued to ultimately force the installation of the equipment.\n\n?It?s baffling Rocky Mountain Power is planning for the future by acting as if it can defy current federal law which requires it to dramatically reduce Utah?s coal power plants emissions,? said Matt Pacenza, executive director of the clean-energy activist organization HEAL Utah.\n\nPacenza noted that Rocky Mountain Power\'s plan indicates it will keep its coal power plants burning in Utah until 2036 ? or longer ? even as it takes other facilities in neighboring states offline sooner.\n\n?The public repeatedly says it wants the utility to move much more urgently to embrace innovative, clean energy,? he said.\n\nThe environmental group also pointed out that the utility has projected what HEAL Utah describes as a \"modest\" decrease in carbon emissions over the next 20 years.\n\nBut Rocky Mountain Power spokesman Dave Eskelsen said critics such as HEAL Utah will only be happy if the utility stops burning fossil fuels altogether and immediately.\n\n\"That\'s not realistic,\" he said.\n\nJon Cox, Rocky Mountain Power\'s vice president of government affairs, said the company\'s $3.5 billion investment in renewable energy is not \"chump change.\"\n\nSen.

You would think a party that hasn\'t won a statewide election since the Clinton administration would be looking for anything that would help them get off the shneid.\n\nThat\'s why it\'s astonishing that the party is virtually ignoring Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams\' success during the 2016 election as they plot a path forward.\n\nPolitical malpractice.\n\nAs we reported earlier, McAdams outperformed the party across Salt Lake County, winning 10 more House districts than other Democrats, including some of the seats the party coveted the most. Hell, McAdams won the home districts of Ken Ivory and LaVar Christensen. Don\'t tell me Democrats wouldn\'t like to get their hands on those seats.\n\nIt doesn\'t take a political genius to figure out that McAdams has found a winning political equation.\n\nHowever, the Democrats seemingly don\'t want any of what he\'s selling.\n\nSources close to McAdams tell UtahPolicy.com that only a handful of the candidates for chair have reached out to McAdams for his expertise, and those conversations have been brief. It\'s puzzling, to say the least.\n\nBut, it\'s also indicative of the systemic problems that plague Utah\'s Democrats. They\'ve been a party at war with itself. One group rails against the more conservative members of their party, calling them \"Republican lite.\" Another wing has an axe to grind against the LDS Church, blaming Utah\'s predominant religion for any and all political defeats they suffer.\n\nPerhaps that\'s why they ignore McAdams. He straddles both of those viewpoints. He\'s a conservative Democrat who just happens to be LDS. The same goes for former Rep. Jim Matheson.\n\nYet, those two have enjoyed the most political success the party has enjoyed in nearly a generation.\n\nThe politically prudent take away is that Utahns will vote for a conservative Democrat. If they\'re LDS, that\'s even better.\n\nThe party is at a crossroads right now. They are still at near-historic lows on Utah\'s Capitol Hill despite picking up one seat in the Utah House in 2016. Despite the fervent hopes of some, the Utah electorate is not trending toward the Democrats. They have to convince Utahns to vote for them. They\'re not going to vote Democrat unless they have a reason to vote Democrat.\n\nWhoever wins the race to be the new party chair must find a way to win elections, and soon.

Orrin Hatch said he would step aside if a \"really outstanding person\" like Mitt Romney were to run for his seat in 2018? That might be happening.\n\nAccording to a report in The Atlantic, Hatch\'s statement caught Romney off guard, but the 70-year-old former GOP presidential nominee is now taking a serious look at the seat.\n\nRomney reportedly spoke with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who encouraged him to run if Hatch\'s seat opens up.\n\nSome sources close to Romney cautioned that he is a naturally deliberative person?just because he?s doing his due diligence in exploring a Senate bid doesn?t mean he?ll actually end up pulling the trigger.

And I don?t think Mitt has anything in his life right now that he?s very passionate about.? Of course, there is no guarantee that Hatch?the longest-serving Republican Senator in Washington?will decide to bow out. GOP leaders in Utah have been quietly discussing for years how best to convince Hatch he should retire?but the subject has taken on a new urgency in recent months, as polls show an overwhelming majority of voters would prefer that he not run again. A few months ago, Hatch and his allies attempted to boost the senator?s standing in the state with a flurry of photo-ops, increased face time in Utah, and glowing op-eds in local papers?but his poll numbers remained stubbornly low. Few in the state?s political and business establishment are willing to force Hatch?s hand. ?We?ll support Orrin if he runs,? said one top Utah Republican, ?but we really hope he doesn?t.? But many are increasingly concerned that the senator is vulnerable to a primary challenge from the right. Several Utah Republicans told me they fear he will be defeated by a principled, but unpredictable, rabble-rouser like Mike Lee. And those closest to Hatch worry that his legacy will be badly damaged if his long career ends in a bloody primary battle. Even if he wins, sources told me, there is concern about how his health and mental acuity will hold up over another six-year term.\n\nTwo Democrats are currently taking a hard look at running for Hatch\'s seat in 2018.

They\'ve told Trump the U.S. Constitution gives Congress sole power to declare war and said the president needs to convince them that they should.\n\n\"While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the United States was not attacked,\" said Sen.

Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, on MSNBC: \"You have to come to Congress.\"\n\nYet that\'s far easier said than done at a time when Congress is deeply polarized and dysfunctional.

Some questions and answers about how and why presidents can conduct military action without permission from the 535 representatives of the American people.\n\nDid Congress know?\n\nTrump did let Congress know of his plans to launch 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles Thursday evening, targeting the air base from which Syrian President Bashar Assad launched a chemical weapons attack earlier this week against his own people, killing more than 80 men, women and children. A White House official said more than two dozen members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, were briefed Thursday by White House and Cabinet officials. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the No. 3 U.S. official, said he was among those informed.\n\nIs informing them enough? Don\'t they get a say?\n\nThe War Powers Resolution, enacted in 1973, long after American troops began fighting in Vietnam, required the president to consult with Congress before sending U.S. armed forces into combat unless there already had been a declaration of war. The troops could not stay more than 90 days unless lawmakers backed the decision. The law also sought to give the president \"leeway to respond to attacks or other emergencies,\" according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAnd it is that leeway that presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and now Trump have used to their advantage. Following the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, Congress gave Bush authority to attack any countries or groups involved in the attacks, which was generally accepted to mean al-Qaida. Obama used that same authority to fight the Islamic State militant group, which emerged in 2014 as an outgrowth of al-Qaida. Trump has used that same authority to continue military action in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.\n\nThe Obama administration maintained in 2011 that U.S. involvement in the months-long air campaign against Libya didn\'t require congressional permission because American forces were largely playing a supporting role as part of an international coalition.\n\nIn February 2015, Obama asked Congress to formally authorize war against the Islamic State, saying the militant group could threaten the U.S. homeland if left unchecked. His resolution would have limited authorization to three years, with no geographic restrictions for U.S. forces. It would have banned \"enduring offensive combat operations,\" an ambiguous term that attempted to define a middle ground between Democrats leery of another protracted Middle Eastern conflict involving ground troops, and Republicans, who largely believe the U.S. needs maximum flexibility to pursue IS.\n\nCongress held a few hearings, but never acted on the proposal.\n\nWhat does Congress think now?\n\nSen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said before Thursday\'s missile launch that he thought it would be prudent to consult with Congress, but didn\'t insist Congress had to approve Trump\'s actions.\n\nAfter the strike, Corker applauded Trump for acting decisively. But he said he wants to know what happens next.\n\n\"As we move forward, it will be important for the administration to engage with Congress and clearly communicate its full strategy to the American people,\" Corker said in a statement.\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, insisted that if the U.S. increased the use of military force in Syria, \"we should follow the Constitution and seek the proper authorization from Congress.\" Kentucky lawmakers Thomas Massie and Rand Paul, both Republicans, agreed.\n\n\"President Trump should make his case in front of the American people and allow their elected representatives to debate the benefits and risks of further Middle East intervention to our national security interests,\" Lee said in a statement.\n\nOther Republicans, like former Trump primary opponent Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, applauded the strikes without mentioning congressional approval.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Wendy Benjaminson contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright ?

A new analysis celebrates the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah for having one of the most ecologically intact landscapes in the West, pointing to the need for continued monument status to protect what\'s on the ground.\n\nPrepared by the Center for American Progress and Conservation Science Partners, the study released this week asserts the Bears Ears region is on par with multiple iconic national parks, including Yellowstone, Glacier, the Grand Canyon and Arches.\n\n?The cultural significance of the area is unparalleled, and this study shows that ?scientifically and environmentally speaking ? Bears Ears has few peers,? said Jenny Rowland, research and advocacy manager for the Public Lands Project at the center.\n\n?Not only is Bears Ears ecologically valuable, but it also holds its own as a national treasure even when compared with some of the nation?s most iconic national parks,\" she added.\n\nThe analysis used 10 ecological indicators comparing Bears Ears to like-sized areas in the West and found it placed in the top 10 percent for ecological intactness, connectivity and night sky darkness. San Juan County is Utah\'s least populated county, its poorest and largest in size ? home to national parks and national monuments that surround much of the Bears Ears region.\n\n\"With its conservation significance among the ranks of our national parks, Bears Ears deserves to be kept in the public?s hands and protected for future generations,? Rowland said.\n\nThe report comes amid the continuing controversy over the new monument and in the same week that newly confirmed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said he\'s reviewing the process for monument designations.\n\n\"Everything is on the board,\" Zinke said during a White House briefing. \"We\'re looking at it. No monument in specific, but looking at the process, looking at the law and making sure the monuments follow the law. At the end of the day, it is important that we operate collaboratively.\"\n\nZinke, a former GOP congressman from Montana, is under pressure by both monument supporters and its critics to visit the rugged region in southeast Utah and talk with those entrenched in the debate.\n\nIn the briefing, he was asked by a reporter what action he might take on another monument ? Gold Butte in Nevada ? which was designated by then-President Barack Obama on the same day as Bears Ears and in the final weeks of his administration.\n\n\"If you are outside of Washington, D.C., there is a lot of anger out there,\" Zinke said. \"And I want the Department of Interior, our rangers and land managers to be first viewed as rangers and land managers, not law enforcement. I don\'t want us to be heavy-handed, and I want us to work with local communities, because it is where we are embedded.\"\n\nUtah\'s top politicians and local elected officials have railed against Bears Ears and want the monument designation rescinded by President Donald Trump or derailed in some sort of legislative action.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, reiterated the litany of complaints over the designation during a speech on the Senate floor Thursday evening.\n\n\"In the parting shot of his presidency, President Obama defied the entire Utah congressional delegation and the will of his own constituents when he declared the Bears Ears National Monument. With a stroke of a pen, he locked away an astonishing 1.35 million acres ? a geographic area larger than the total acreage of all five of Utah\'s national parks combined,\" Hatch said.\n\nThe country\'s most senior sitting senator added that he has pressed Trump on the public lands issue during a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office.\n\n\"Our president assured us that he stands ready to work with us to fix this disaster. More than any of his predecessors, President Trump understands what\'s at stake here,\" Hatch said.\n\nThe Center for American Progress\' report on Bears Ears National Monument said the political sentiments of Utah leaders like Hatch underscores the need for continued protections.\n\n?Efforts to get rid of protections for the area should be seen for what they are: a sellout of our national heritage to special interests,\" Rowland said. The report, Rowland notes, says the area\'s vulnerability to mining and oil and gas development is high without monument protections.\n\nBut critics of the monument and the Bureau of Land Management say otherwise, with a federal agency assessment that says the majority of the land in the Bear Ears footprint has low-to-moderate potential for oil and gas development and much of the area was already closed to leasing or had restrictions. A proposed uranium mine expansion lies outside the monument\'s boundaries, although BLM maps show there may be some high mining potential for uranium within the monument.\n\nJami Bayles, president of the Stewards of San Juan County, said the report was generated by its own special interests.\n\n\"The fact that this analysis was carried out by the Center for American Progress is quite telling,\" she said. \"The center works arm in arm with the Conservation Lands Foundation, who has been a major promoter of the Bears Ears Monument. So to say that the reason people oppose the monument is because they want to drill for oil and develop the area is a fallacy. We oppose it because we don?t want to lose our little community and become the next Moab.\"\n\nBayles said the report, by comparing Bears Ears with national parks, misses its own point.\n\n\"The analysis showed that Bears Ears exceeded several national parks including Arches, Grand Canyon and Yellowstone in a variety of ecological categories. Could that be because it?s located in an area that has never had a massive, overcrowded, and overdeveloped recreation and tourist economy? We simply don\'t want the land to change. We?ve kept it pristine for decades, and we don?t need monument or park status to keep it that way.\"\n\nSen. David Hinkins, R-Orangeville, whose district includes the Bears Ears region, added that making the area a monument is the best way to jeopardize its landscape.\n\n\"Publicizing it like this in this report is not going to be doing it any favors,\" he said. \"It seems backward to me. Evidently all this has happened with it being so wonderful with protections that have been around 50 to 100 years. So why do you want to make it an attraction for people to come?\"\n\nThe BLM said it has been struggling with increased visitation to the region in the last couple years and the publicity surrounding Bears Ears is driving more people to visit.\n\n\"We are sensing that a lot of them are not familiar with the area,\" said BLM spokeswoman Lisa Bryant.\n\n\"These canyonlands are a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle and are also far away from gas stations and convenience stores,\" she added. \"So we ask that everyone be prepared with proper clothing, water, food, maps and obtain the necessary permits before entering the backcountry.\"\n\nShe said that the BLM is working with partners that include the Blanding Visitor\'s Center and National Park Service offices to educate visitors about being safe on the public lands and exercising respect for cultural artifacts they may come across. In addition, the agency has prepared a brochure to provide additional information to would-be tourists and visitors.\n\nThe Bears Ears National Monument proposal captured the attention of Washington, D.C., after an intense campaign by a coalition of five Native American tribes that worked with environmental groups to lobby for monument protections for land they say is sacred.\n\nThe tribes sought a co-management strategy with the federal government that was recognized in Obama\'s monument proclamation issued last December. That management includes a tribal commission with representatives from Native American tribes from the region.',NULL,NULL),(31,'https://www.ksl.com/?sid=43942403&nid=148','KSL','2017-04-21 07:42:17.000000','2017-04-22 09:45:23.000000','Gov.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who rode a wave of progressive support to challenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, returned to one of the states that offered him a strong base.\n\nThis time it was to unite a somewhat fractured party against a common enemy: President Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled congress.\n\nSen. Sanders appeared alongside newly elected Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez as part of a nationwide \"unity tour.\" They spoke to a crowd of about 3,000 Democrats and progressives in Salt Lake City on Friday.\n\n\"This is not about Bernie Sanders. This is not about Tom Perez. This is not about anybody else,\" Sanders told the crowd. \"You know what this whole thing is about? It?s about you! And it?s about your children and it?s about your parents, and it?s about the environment.\"\n\nWatch the rally here:\n\nThe \"Come Together and Fight Back\" tour is meant to unify Democrats who have seen fracturing and infighting following last year\'s losses in the November election. Progressives within the party backed Sanders, and there were still signs of resentment against establishment Democrats.

He earned cheers from the crowd whenever he brought up the fact that Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz is leaving office.\n\nEven Sanders chided the party from the stage.\n\n\"The Democratic Party has kind of turned its back on a lot of states in this country and I think that was a mistake. I think Tom Perez being here today tells you those days are over,\" he said, later adding: \"What the Democratic Party has also got to become is a grassroots party. A party where decisions are made from the bottom on up.\"\n\nLike his previous stops in Utah, Sanders was greeted with wild cheers. His speech on Friday sounded a lot like a presidential campaign stump speech where he touched on issues that made him popular: universal health care, free college tuition, immigration and equal rights.\n\nSupporters certainly hoped he would run for president again in 2020.

You have no place to go but up,\" he said.\n\nWearing a blue dress shirt and no tie, Sanders spoke from a stage dominated by a giant American flag and filled with Utah Democrats holding \"Come Together\" and \"Fight Back\" signs.\n\n\"Brothers and sisters, we are in the majority not the minority,\" Sanders said.\n\nHe talked about the same issues that fueled his surprisingly strong 2016 presidential campaign, including the need for universal health care, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, pay equity, free higher education and 12 weeks of paid family leave.\n\n\"As the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, we can and we must create an economy that works for all people,\" not just the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, Sanders said.\n\nAlso, he pledged to fight for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship for those in the country illegally, and declared climate change not only real but a threat that unchecked will lead to global conflict over dwindling resources.\n\nSanders and Democratic National Party Chairman Tom Perez are traveling to largely Republican states like Utah, including Arizona on Friday evening, to deliver a message of party unity after last year\'s divisive primary.\n\nAs the wealthiest nation in the history of the world we can and we must create an economy that works for all people. ?Bernie Sanders\n\nNearly 80 percent of Utah Democrats backed Sanders in the March 2016 presidential preference votes over the party\'s eventual nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut Utah, a state that hasn\'t voted for a Democrat for president since 1964, went for the Republican nominee, now-President Donald Trump, last year.\n\nPerez, who came to Utah earlier this year to meet with local Democrats, tried to fire up the crowd before Sanders took the stage by calling Trump the \"most dangerous president in American history\" and urged them to stand up for Democratic values.\n\nThere were a few jeers aimed at Perez, who defeated a more progressive Democrat to win the party\'s chairmanship earlier this year, but he drew big cheers when he brought up Rep. Jason Chaffetz\'s surprise decision not to run for re-election.\n\n\"We\'re going to put Democratic House seats right here in Utah,\" Perez said, calling Chaffetz\'s raucous town hall meeting last February one of the first indicators of increased energy among Democrats after Trump took office.\n\n\"Thank you for fighting back,\" Perez said, telling the crowd they\'d shifted the focus nationally. \"They were writing the obituary for the Affordable Care Act. Now, they\'re writing the obituary for Jason Chaffetz. And they\'ll continue doing that.\"\n\nChaffetz, first elected in 2008 and the chairman of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, announced earlier this week he would not seek re-election in 2018 and later confirmed he may step down before his term ends.\n\nBefore the rally kicked off about a half-hour late, Perez told reporters the national party was \"infrastructure building\" to help states like Utah that he said haven\'t had enough support in the past.\n\nPeople wait in line to attend the \"Come Together and Fight Back\" Tour with Senator Bernie Sanders and Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez at the Rail Event Center in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 21, 2017.

If there is a special election to fill Chaffetz\'s seat, Perez said the national party will back the pick of Utah Democrats.\n\n\"We\'re not here to bless one particular candidate,\" he said.\n\nAt least two Democrats are in the race for Chaffetz\'s 3rd District seat, Cottonwood Heights doctor Kathryn Allen, who has outraised the five-term congressman, and Ben Frank, a student who volunteered for Sanders\' campaign.\n\nGOP state and national party leaders were critical of the Salt Lake City rally.\n\n\"Utah voters have time and again rejected the far-left policies that Sanders and the Democrat establishment are doubling down on,\" Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.\n\nJames Evans, Utah GOP chairman, held a news conference during the rally.\n\n\"Based on the reactions of Utah Democrats, it appears going forward their strategy is to embrace socialism,\" Evans said, referring to Sanders\' self-described Democratic socialism.\n\nThe line to get into the free event stretched from the event center at 235 N. 500 West around the block to 600 West, and people started arriving as early as 5:30 a.m. to ensure they could get inside.\n\nWe can succeed only to the extent that we have strong parties across this country.

Orrin Hatch, who recently visited the Bears Ears region in southeast Utah and called on Trump to correct the \"monumental mess\" created by President Barak Obama last December, said he\'s hopeful the review will be followed by action.\n\n\"I am grateful that the president has demonstrated his commitment to work with me on this vitally important issue and deliver real results for the Utahns most affected by these massive federal land grabs,\" Hatch, R-Utah, said in a statement.\n\nEnvironmental group Friends of Cedar Mesa said if the review is simply \"shorthand\" for only listening to political opponents of the designation, it is waste of time and tax dollars.\n\nHatch, the nation\'s senior most senator, said he has met privately with Trump to discuss the \"egregious abuse\" of the Antiquities Act, a 1906 law that gives U.S. presidents the authority to designate monuments to protect ancient cultural resources under threat.\n\nOn Dec. 28, Obama set aside 1.35 million acres in San Juan County as the Bears Ears National Monument after a national campaign by Native American tribes and environmental groups pushed for protections for the culturally rich landscape.\n\nThe designation sparked immediate condemnation from Utah\'s conservative politicians, who denounced the move as a late-hour exercise in overreach by a Democratic president on his way out the door.\n\nRep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, said in an interview Monday on KSL Newsradio\'s \"The Doug Wright Show\" that Trump is going about it the \"right way\" by undertaking a review of designations, particularly those with a large footprint.\n\n\"Trump is going to ask for a review by the secretary of the Interior and then a report, and probably also a report coming from the Department of Justice on what options the president has under the Antiquities Act,\" Bishop said.\n\nThere\'s more than just Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante up for review and possible action, he pointed out, listing monuments in Maine, Nevada and the Pacific Ocean that been accompanied by controversy.\n\nNo president has ever rescinded a monument designation in U.S. history, but Bishop said that doesn\'t mean it can\'t be done.\n\n\"What can be done by fiat can be undone by fiat,\" Bishop said.\n\nCongress, he added, reduced in size one monument by 90 percent, so there are legislative options available as well.\n\nWillie Grayeyes, board chairman of Native American advocacy organization Utah Dine Bikeyah, predicted the Bears Ears National Monument will withstand the scrutiny of the Trump administration.\n\n?It would seem that this executive order may suggest that the White House realizes it does not have the legal authority to diminish or undo Antiquities Act proclamations. So while Utah Dine Bikeyah condemns this partisan attack, we also believe Bears Ears National Monument to be the most qualified area designated in the past 21 years, and also the most thoroughly studied, researched and vetted by all sides,\" he said.\n\n\"This monument enjoys wide support in Utah, is an economic driver for our reservation communities here in San Juan County, and it enables more local control and stewardship of the region by local tribes and Utahns,\" Grayeyes added.\n\nFriends of Cedar Mesa, a conservation group that pushed strongly for the monument, added that the review would be welcome if it\'s conducted with sincerity.\n\n\"I welcome any real, fact-based review of the Bears Ears monument, which holds more archaeological sites than any other U.S. national park or national monument,\" said Josh Ewing, the group\'s executive director.\n\n\"As you know, former Interior Secretary Sally Jewell spent extensive time studying this issue, spending multiple days on the ground and hosting a public meeting with more than 1,500 people,\" Ewing said. \"If that kind of effort is taken to talk to all sides ? most importantly sovereign Native American tribes ? I\'m confident a review will confirm the international importance of the Bears Ears cultural landscape.\"\n\nBut Bishop said it is imperative ? and better for Native Americans with an interest in the area ? for the monument to come about through legislation.\n\nHe said he will have a bill ready to go should the designation be undone and stressed that it will have \"the right kind of management, the right kind of protections. We will do it the right way.\"\n\nBoth Bishop and Boyd Matheson, president of the conservative Sutherland Institute, said the congressional appetite may be ripe for a makeover of the Antiquities Act to assure a more public process.\n\n\"I think it is time for a real review of the Antiquities Act and to get it on par to where it should be,\" Matheson said. \"One of the important things to remember is that the language of the Antiquities Act is that it should be used to protect the smallest area possible. The review the president is calling for is a great step one, but Congress needs to get involved.\"',NULL,NULL),(40,'http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865678491/Governor-appoints-new-member-to-State-Charter-School-Board.html','Deseret News','2017-04-24 15:43:31.000000','2017-04-24 06:43:54.000000','Governor appoints new member to State Charter School Board','[u\'Deseret News\']','charter phillips weilenmann work school appoints member experience state weilenmannphillips board governor appointed','Gary Herbert has appointed Cynthia K.

Clinton had named the nearly 1.9 million-acre Grand Staircase in September 1996.\n\nMany of Utah\'s top federal and state officials have called for a rescission ? or at least a resizing ? of the Grand Staircase and Bears Ears monuments.\n\nWhile no president has attempted to withdraw a monument named by a predecessor, there have been those who have scaled back those designations.\n\nFor his part, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has pressed Trump for action on the Bears Ears declaration and visited the area last week.\n\n\"For years, I have fought every step of the way to ensure that our lands are managed by the Utahns [who] know them best and cherish them deeply,\" Hatch said in a statement Sunday night. \"That\'s why I\'m committed to rolling back the egregious abuse of the Antiquities Act to serve far-left special interests. As part of this commitment, I have leveraged all of my influence ? from private meetings in the Oval Office in the president\'s first week in office to my latest trip to Bears Ears this week ? to ensure that this issue is a priority on the president\'s agenda.\"\n\nEnvironmental groups quickly raised concerns that Trump was acting without looking at the reasons that Obama used the 1906 Antiquities Act to preserve the 1.35 million acres of Bears Ears as well as the now 20-year-old Grand Staircase.\n\n\"Utah\'s national monuments are our first line of defense against the very real specter of climate change, providing resiliency to not only the species within them, but also to nearby communities,\" said Jen Ujifusa, legislative director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. \"President Trump and the Utah delegation should focus their energies on solving America\'s challenges, rather than unraveling the solutions that are already working.\"\n\nJosh Ewing, executive director of the Friends of Cedar Mesa, which along with an American Indian tribal coalition had pushed for the monument declaration, said he welcomes the review because, if done correctly, it will show the need for protection of the area.\n\n\"I would look forward to a serious review of Bears Ears by the secretary and by the Interior [Department],\" Ewing said. \"I think the conclusion they would come to, if they really look at the international significance of this place, is they would come to the same conclusion that [former Interior] Secretary [Sally] Jewell did after spending five days on the ground and a huge public meeting ? which is that this place deserves to be protected and the only practical way to protect it is the Antiquities Act. So I would welcome a review as long as it is a serious one where they spend time on the ground and look at the resources and look at the data.\"\n\nUtah\'s federal and state leaders had been pushing a legislative solution to shield the Bears Ears and other areas. But the measure, which some complained was too friendly to mining and development interests, failed to pass in the waning days of the past congressional session after tribal and environmental groups complained that their concerns were ignored.\n\ntburr@sltrib.com',NULL,NULL),(43,'http://www.sltrib.com/news/5200833-155/developer-terry-diehl-may-be-bankrupt','Salt Lake Tribune','2017-04-23 12:54:31.000000','2017-04-24 06:44:08.000000','Developer Terry Diehl may be bankrupt and facing charges, but it looks like a pretty good life','[u\'Jennifer Dobner And Tom Harvey The Salt Lake Tribune\', u\'Jennifer Dobner\', u\'Tom Harvey\']','jones million life good bankrupt draper charges bankruptcy diehl hughes facing board uta looks pretty terry diehls developer','\"Mr. Diehl is not the developer on the project but rather his involvement has been due to his position on the UTA board of directors,\" Stenquist wrote.\nMoreover, Jones and Diehl had worked together when Jones was a Cottonwood Heights councilman supporting the developer\'s controversial Tavaci project in that city.\n—Cliff\'s edge • Orrin Colby Jr., who served with Diehl on the UTA board, was more generous with his impressions, noting Diehl\'s smarts and large, fun-loving personality.\nBradley recalled his discomfort with Diehl in the 1990s when the county bought the South Mountain Golf Course from Diehl.\nCurtis, Diehl and Hughes all were involved in site-selection decisions for the train station in Draper back in 2008 and 2009.','At 61, Diehl could the name be more apt? has been behind some of the biggest real estate deals along the Wasatch Front and helped shape Utah\'s award-winning public transit system, while weathering countless civil lawsuits, rumors about having politicians in his back pocket and two scathing legislative audits that, in part, challenged his role in more than one multimillion-dollar land deal surrounding UTA transit-station developments.\n\nNow, those same land transactions may be Diehl\'s undoing.\n\nOn April 5, a federal grand jury indicted Diehl on 12 criminal counts related to his 2012 bankruptcy, renewing old allegations that he may have misappropriated funds from business deals and used insider information from UTA to influence decisions and enrich himself.\n\nThe indictment followed on the heels of an announcement that Utah\'s U.S. attorney\'s office had struck an immunity deal with UTA in exchange for the agency\'s cooperation in an ongoing investigation into current and former UTA officials and others involving property purchases and developments around transit stations.\n\nThe charges allege that Diehl falsely reported his income or concealed assets ? including more than $1 million from the sale of land interests near the Draper FrontRunner station ? that should have been disclosed to the bankruptcy court.\n\nDiehl maintained his innocence in a text message to The Salt Lake Tribune on the day the indictment was made public.\n\n\"I obviously disagree with the government regarding the details involved with my bankruptcy,\" he wrote. \"I look forward to proving my innocence and having my day in court.\"\n\n?\n\nMum\'s the word ? Diehl declined a request for an interview for this story. He isn\'t the only one.\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune called more than two dozen individuals with ties or past dealings with the developer, with little success.\n\nMost, including some Diehl family members, failed to return messages, or declined to comment.\n\nOthers ? UTA\'s former top attorney Bruce Jones among them ? insisted they just didn\'t know Diehl well.\n\n\"He was on the board of UTA and I was general counsel,\" Jones said. \"That\'s my only interaction with him. ? There are better sources.\"\n\nActually, Jones worked closely with Diehl for years when Jones was in charge not just of UTA legal affairs but also oversaw developments at train stations as Diehl and others bought properties and moved forward with construction of housing, retail stores and offices. Moreover, Jones and Diehl had worked together when Jones was a Cottonwood Heights councilman supporting the developer\'s controversial Tavaci project in that city.\n\nUtah House Speaker Greg Hughes, R-Draper, who in the past has publicly acknowledged his tight friendship with Diehl, also has gone silent. Through a spokesman, Hughes declined to comment, pointing The Tribune to a statement issued by his attorney the day Diehl\'s indictment was handed up. In it, attorney Brett Parkinson said Hughes \"has offered and continues to offer his assistance\" to federal authorities, and \"out of respect for their investigation, we cannot comment further.\"\n\nThere\'s a reason no one wants to speak publicly about Diehl, says Claire Geddes. \"They are scared of him.\"\n\nA longtime government watchdog who fought UTA on the Draper station and battled Diehl over the Big Cottonwood Canyon-area Tavaci development, Geddes said she, too, had to be careful.\n\n\"I\'m only saying things that are already public,\" said Geddes. \"I don\'t want to get sued.\"\n\n?\n\nCliff\'s edge ? Orrin Colby Jr., who served with Diehl on the UTA board, was more generous with his impressions, noting Diehl\'s smarts and large, fun-loving personality.\n\n\"He enjoys having people around him, particularly well-connected people,\" Colby said.\n\nHe also \"lived high\" on what appeared to be ample assets, Colby said, but was known for his generosity to others and his risk-taking nature.\n\nColby also said that trying to characterize Diehl reminded him of an anecdote about interviewing stagecoach drivers in the Old West. The critical question: whether the applicant might drive his rig within 6 inches of the cliff, or stay far away.\n\n\"Terry is more of a 6-incher,\" Colby said.\n\nSalt Lake County Councilman Jim Bradley said Diehl is not unlike others who seek the county\'s blessing on big development projects.\n\n\"He was usually asking for things that were totally out of a sense of appropriateness,\" Bradley said, \"and also always had some cloud of misdoing around him.\"\n\nBradley recalled his discomfort with Diehl in the 1990s when the county bought the South Mountain Golf Course from Diehl.\n\n\"I thought the county was disadvantaged in terms of transactions out there,\" said Bradley. \"I can\'t remember the details, but it was a fast one, like all his things are.\"\n\nThe county paid much more than was reasonable, according to an audit, and the deal ended on a sour note, Bradley said.\n\n\"They didn\'t sell the golf carts to us,\" Bradley said. \"We had to go back and spend several hundred thousand dollars to buy the golf carts. It was just crap like that.\"\n\nGeddes said Diehl and his projects have long benefited from having friends in high places. Hughes, for example, served on the UTA board with Diehl and showed up at the developer\'s side for a Tavaci-related Cottonwood Heights City Council meeting, where Diehl also had the support of Jones, a councilman.\n\n\"He\'s a very well-connected developer who is able to do a lot of things that most people wouldn\'t be able to do,\" she said.\n\nThere\'s also been a widely held perception that Diehl benefited through the years from his close relationship with the late Salt Lake County Councilman Randy Horiuchi, who lived in Diehl\'s well-appointed 9,200-square foot home for a while following a divorce.\n\nAt a 2013 council meeting, Horiuchi spoke in favor of the Tavaci development as he chastised environmentalists for their opposition and their criticism of his friendship with Diehl. He even complained of being photographed by activists at Diehl\'s house before unapologetically voting for the project ? albeit on the losing side.\n\nThe two were \"very, very close,\" Bradley said.\n\n?\n\nUTA deals ? First appointed to the UTA board in 2001, Diehl is said to have cultivated support not only from Hughes but also from former House Speaker Greg Curtis, a Sandy Republican who later became a UTA lobbyist. Curtis, Diehl and Hughes all were involved in site-selection decisions for the train station in Draper back in 2008 and 2009.\n\nAt the time, Diehl was not only a UTA board member but half-owner of a company that held an interest in the property adjacent to the planned FrontRunner site ? a fact that came to light later, through a civil lawsuit filing and a 2010 legislative audit, which concluded Diehl may have violated Utah\'s law concerning the misuse of insider information and made in the neighborhood of $20 million on the deal.\n\nAuditors in a subsequent investigation in 2014 criticized UTA\'s sweetheart deals, extravagant pay and bonuses and found that UTA was acting like a bank for developers, including $10 million that was paid in December 2010 to one-time Diehl partner Jeff Vitek for a parking garage at a time when there were no plans to build one.\n\nBetween the two probes, Diehl resigned from the UTA board in 2011 amid lingering conflict-of-interest allegations but not before Hughes and the rest of the trustees granted him a waiver from normal rules banning former board members from doing business with the agency for one year. Within months, he was back at UTA headquarters looking for business. Then, on March 30, 2012, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, listing $3.58 million in assets and $47.5 million in liabilities.\n\n?\n\nBroke, not busted ? Included among Diehl\'s detailed assets: His five-bedroom, six-bath with separate guest quarters and private office Cottonwood Heights home listed at $2.3 million ? although it is currently on the market at a \"huge discount\" of $3.95 million ? $1.1 million condo on Coronado Island, Calif., along with a Cadillac Escalade worth $40,000, a Mercedes worth $20,270, 80 bottles of wine valued at $5,000 and a Glen Wild County Club membership of $87,000.\n\nOn paper, it seems like an enviable life.\n\nBut court filings show Diehl\'s homes and vehicles were encumbered with debt and say he owed more than $35 million to financial institutions and his former business partner, Michael Bodell.\n\nThe bankruptcy appears to have been triggered by a bank\'s move to foreclose on Diehl\'s home. But documents filed in the case show Diehl did not appear to be slowing his spending as the bankruptcy loomed.\n\nBeginning on Feb. 19, 2012, Diehl charged $11,907.27 on a Diners Club credit card, purchasing plane tickets on two Philippines-based airline carriers in March and charging a March 19 payment for services at a plastic surgery clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, along with a string of other purchases, including multiple payments to Western Union, the documents show.\n\nDiehl also owed $450,000 to casinos, $300,000 of that to the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.\n\nMGM\'s claim says that Diehl drew four checks from the casino all on the same day ? March 28, two days before the bankruptcy filing. In addition, he owed $150,000 to the Aria casino, although the date he incurred that debt isn\'t stated.\n\nFederal prosecutors contend that Diehl lied about his gross income during the two years leading up to the bankruptcy, claiming an income of just $376,708.83.\n\n\"In truth and fact, defendant Diehl received over $1 million in gross income from the operation of his business involving real property stemming from a UTA FrontRunner transit oriented development at 12800 South in Draper beginning in 2008,\" the charges state.\n\n?\n\nThe other side? ? Draper resident Joan Little acknowledges she raised a glass of wine or two when she heard that Diehl had been indicted.\n\nThe former head of the South Mountain Homeowners Association was among residents who complained to her city\'s council about Diehl at the time of the train station planning. In an email ? subject line: \"Who owns Draper City\" ? Little challenged the council\'s support for the transit development project and the changes being made to city ordinances, all of which benefited Diehl.\n\nLittle said she spoke up after watching Diehl essentially direct the rewriting of the municipal code by the city manager and staff during a November 2008 meeting.\n\n\"Why would he be dictating a city code?\" she said, adding that she understood Diehl to be the developer in line for the project. \"That\'s why I questioned, why would the developer be involved?\"\n\nIn the email, which she provided to The Tribune, Little asked the city to hold off on voting to approve changes to city code and a developer agreement, which she said would \"saddle Draper citizens with millions $20+ million and counting of dollars of infrastructure costs that will benefit only the developer Terry Diehl.\"\n\nIn a response, Councilman Jeff Stenquist called Little \"grossly misinformed.\"\n\n\"Mr. Diehl is not the developer on the project but rather his involvement has been due to his position on the UTA board of directors,\" Stenquist wrote.\n\nColby, who was the vice chairman of UTA\'s board when the Draper station deals were inked in 2009, said questions about Diehl\'s alleged maneuvering on the Draper project were raised as he was leaving the board.\n\n\"I never took an opportunity to personally confront him about this,\" Colby said, adding that he \"never once felt like Terry told me a lie.\"\n\nIn fact, his bent for pushing the envelope and thinking outside the box was often good for the board, Colby said, because he prompted questions and discussion that helped trustees see possibilities that were not otherwise obvious,\n\nThat Diehl filed bankruptcy isn\'t too troubling, Colby said, because many of developers have been tossed around on the boom-and-bust waves of real estate.\n\nHe also said he\'s reserving judgment about the criminal charges brought by federal prosecutors.\n\n\"I\'ve been close enough to legal matters in my career that I\'ve learned charges are easy to come by,\" he said. \"There is always another side to the story, and I don\'t think we\'ve heard that yet.\"\n\n?

Hatch and other members of Utah\'s congressional delegation are pushing to rescind the action.\n\n\"This monument enjoys wide support in Utah, is an economic driver for our reservation communities here in San Juan County, and it enables more local control and stewardship of the region by local tribes and Utahns,\" Grayeyes added.\n\nFriends of Cedar Mesa, a conservation group that pushed strongly for the monument, added that the review would be welcome if it\'s conducted with sincerity.\n\n\"I welcome any real, fact-based review of the Bears Ears monument, which holds more archaeological sites than any other U.S. national park or national monument,\" said Josh Ewing, the group\'s executive director.\n\n\"As you know, former Interior Secretary Sally Jewell spent extensive time studying this issue, spending multiple days on the ground and hosting a public meeting with more than 1,500 people,\" Ewing said. \"If that kind of effort is taken to talk to all sides ? most importantly sovereign Native American tribes ? I\'m confident a review will confirm the international importance of the Bears Ears cultural landscape.\"\n\nBut Bishop said it is imperative ? and better for Native Americans with an interest in the area ? for the monument to come about through legislation.\n\nHe said he will have a bill ready to go should the designation be undone and stressed that it will have \"the right kind of management, the right kind of protections. We will do it the right way.\"\n\nBoth Bishop and Boyd Matheson, president of the conservative Sutherland Institute, said the congressional appetite may be ripe for a makeover of the Antiquities Act to assure a more public process.\n\n\"I think it is time for a real review of the Antiquities Act and to get it on par to where it should be,\" Matheson said. \"One of the important things to remember is that the language of the Antiquities Act is that it should be used to protect the smallest area possible. ? The review the president is calling for is a great step one, but Congress needs to get involved.\"\n\nRelated Stories\n\nAmy Joi O\'Donoghue Amy Joi O\'Donoghue ?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n11 Pending Comments',NULL,NULL),(45,'https://www.ksl.com/?sid=43979264&nid=757','KSL','2017-04-23 18:02:31.000000','2017-04-24 06:44:16.000000','New law aims to help job applicants with criminal history','[u\'Price - Associated Press\', u\'Michelle L\']','law help getting justice utah state aims record job history know interview criminal applicants','Related:Legislature takes action on law enforcement, criminal justice reforms Utah lawmakers dealt with a varied set of proposals for law enforcement and criminal justice reforms during their 45-day period of policy debates.\nSALT LAKE CITY — Job applicants who\'ve been convicted of a crime won\'t have to disclose their criminal record before some job interviews under a new Utah law aiming to help convicts find work after prison.\nIf there\'s no interview process for the job, then the employer can\'t ask about a criminal record until a conditional job offer is made to the applicant.\nThe rules won\'t apply to government jobs in law enforcement, criminal or juvenile justice, or any work with children or vulnerable adults.\nHe says that opportunity to explain himself, instead of being judged by his criminal record, helped him get where he is today — a second-year law student at BYU.','SALT LAKE CITY ? Job applicants who\'ve been convicted of a crime won\'t have to disclose their criminal record before some job interviews under a new Utah law aiming to help convicts find work after prison.\n\nThe legislation only applies to government jobs, but supporters say they hope more private employers adopt the practice.\n\nRep. Sandra Hollins, a social worker who sponsored the new law, said people who have served time behind bars often find it tough to become a member of the workforce again if they\'re required on job applications to disclose or list criminal convictions before getting a chance to explain themselves.\n\n\"You at least need to get the foot in the door,\" said Hollins, D-Salt Lake City. \"My goal is to have the person get into the interview based on their qualifications.\"\n\nThe new law, which takes effect May 9, says government employers can\'t exclude someone from getting a job interview if the applicant has been convicted of a crime, and they can\'t ask about a criminal record before the interview.\n\nHollins said once that person gets the interview, the employer can ask about the applicant\'s history and decide whether to hire the person. If there\'s no interview process for the job, then the employer can\'t ask about a criminal record until a conditional job offer is made to the applicant.\n\nThe rules won\'t apply to government jobs in law enforcement, criminal or juvenile justice, or any work with children or vulnerable adults. Any government agency that mainly handles finances or a fiduciary role would also be exempt, as would the Utah State Tax Commission and state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.\n\nHollins\' legislation, which passed with bipartisan support, puts Utah in league with 20 other states with both conservative and liberal politics that have adopted similar rules, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nPeople getting out of jail and prison, people with felony convictions ? all of us know we have something to prove.

This has been the case since the founding of the Mormon faith in Utah, over 150 years ago.\n\n-- But in recent times you can add the names of Huntsman and Miller.\n\nThe Huntsmans have given more than $1 billion to cancer research, and raised another $1 billion for the Huntsman Cancer Institute the research center and the Huntsman Cancer Hospital the treatment facility, all built above the U. of U. hospital and related facilities high on a hill overlooking the valley.\n\n-- And the family of the late Larry H. Miller, led by wife Gail Miller, have through a special trust basically given the people of Utah the Jazz, the NBA franchise here, and the team?s arena in downtown Salt Lake City.\n\nWhen Huntsman Sr. controlled the chemical empire he was reported by Forbes as the richest man in Utah.\n\nNow, with the divestiture of the firm?s stock to sons and daughters and to the cancer-fighting foundation, Huntsman?s wealth is smaller.\n\nAnd into that wealth void steps Gail Miller, recently listed as the richest person in Utah.\n\nThese days, you take on any of these three institutions ? and the people who run them ? at your own risk.\n\nYou may have noticed that no political leaders, including Gov. Gary Herbert, are stepping into the fray trying to mediate this mess.\n\nHuntsman Sr. says it is a ?power grab? by the U. administration, trying to gain operational and financial control of the HCI and hospital, which he says are making money.\n\nWhile U. officials are remaining quiet, I?m hearing that they have for some time tried to rein in Dr. Beckerle, who reportedly was more interested in reporting back to Huntsman on her administration, rather than dealing with Lee, Pershing and other U. administrators.\n\nBut now personalities are involved, a dedicated director has lost her job, and the implications ? Pershing put off a Friday meeting where Huntsman officials were prepared to donate another $120 million to the institutions involved ? of real financial harm are immense.\n\nOfficially, Herbert has little power here ? he nominates folks to the Board of Regents, which oversees all of Utah?s colleges and university.\n\nPershing serves at the pleasure of the regents.\n\nMeanwhile, the U. of U. board of trustees, which oversees the U. itself, is stacked with other Utah business and big-money leaders ? recognize the names Price, Gardner, Eccles and Sorenson?\n\nAnd the U. has said that Beckerle?s dismissal was run past ?senior? members of the trustee board.\n\nThe chair of the trustee board is H. David Burton, who as head of the Mormon Church?s bishopric a few years back oversaw the building of the multi-billion-dollar City Creek Center and other important temporal relations with Salt Lake City and Utah state government.\n\nNow outside of the LDS Church?s hierarchy, he still carries a lot of water with the church leadership.\n\nBut Huntsman Sr. is the son-in-law of the late LDS Apostle David B. Haight, and served in one of the Quorums of the Seventy himself. And his connection to church leaders is also strong.\n\nIn short, in the Beckerle matter, if the pressure isn?t quickly relieved, and solutions found, there is the making of a political/media/U. of U. financial mess that could take years of work to rebuild ? if it could ever be so.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.',NULL,NULL),(47,'http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/13015-poll-most-utahns-give-2017-legislature-passing-grades','Utah Policy','2017-04-24 18:43:31.000000','2017-04-24 06:44:32.000000','Most Utahns give 2017 Legislature passing grades','[u\'Contributing Editor\', u\'Bob Bernick\']','legislature b d house republicans tax state grades lawmakers utahns passing 2017 say','Poll: Most Utahns give 2017 Legislature passing gradesNearly two-thirds of Utahns give state lawmakers a passing grade for their 2017 general session, finished last month, a new UtahPolicy.com poll shows.\nJones finds that Republicans give the Legislature – dominated by their same political party lawmakers – much higher grades than do Democrats and independents:44 percent of Utah Republicans say the Legislature should get a B this term – 72 percent say passing grades combined.\nFor the purposes of this analysis, an A, B, or C is considered passing, a D or F not passing.\nOnly 8 percent of Republicans say the Legislature should fail.\nBut while GOP senators seemed interested in such moves, House Republicans stalled.','Poll: Most Utahns give 2017 Legislature passing grades\n\nNearly two-thirds of Utahns give state lawmakers a passing grade for their 2017 general session, finished last month, a new UtahPolicy.com poll shows.\n\nDan Jones & Associates asked if the GOP-controlled Legislature should get an A, B, C, D, F, or an incomplete for its 45-day annual session.\n\nFor the purposes of this analysis, an A, B, or C is considered passing, a D or F not passing.\n\nJones finds:\n\nOnly 5 percent of the state said the Legislature deserves an A.

In President Trump, we have a leader who is committed to defending the Western way of life. I am deeply grateful for his willingness to work with us to undo the harm caused by the overreach of his predecessors.\n\nThe full speech, as prepared for delivery, is below:\n\nMr. President, last week, I had the opportunity to return home to visit the recently declared Bears Ears National Monument. This federal designation encompasses roughly 1.35 million acres in Utah and is located in one of our country?s most remote communities: San Juan County.\n\nFor decades, this quiet county remained largely untouched by the tensions of modern life and the taint of Washington politics. But no more. San Juan County is now the epicenter of a brutal battle over public lands?the outcome of which will have long-lasting consequences, not only for Utah but for the entire nation.\n\nIn geographical terms, San Juan County is massive. It?s the largest county in the State of Utah and the second-largest county in the United States. To put the size of San Juan County in perspective, consider that the county itself is larger than several states, including Connecticut, Delaware, and Rhode Island.\n\nSan Juan County alone accounts for nearly ten percent of all land in Utah. Yet Utahns have very little say in what actually goes on there. That?s because the federal government administers the vast majority of San Juan County. Incredibly, just eight percent of the county?s land is under private ownership while an area of more thantwo million acres is controlled by the Bureau of Land Management.\n\nThis means that, for years, my constituents, who depend on the land?s resources, have been at the mercy of out-of-touch bureaucrats who have little knowledge or personal connection to the land. President Obama only made matters worse when he spurned the men and women of San Juan County by declaring the Bears Ears National Monument last December. In doing so, he defied the will of the state legislature, the Governor, and the entire Utah Congressional delegation. President Obama?s midnight monument designation imposed even greater land-use restrictions on a region that is already predominantly controlled by the federal government.\n\nThis last-minute monument designation was a case study in presidential hubris. In making this unilateral decision, our former President either failed to heed the concerns of San Juan County residents or ignored them completely. As evidence of his disdain, President Obama issued this declaration with no open debate, no public hearing, and no vote in Congress. Utahns are now suffering the consequences of his recklessness.\n\nWhen I visited the Bears Ears region last week, I met with small business owners and local officials who lamented the fact that the Obama administration never even gave them the courtesy of a simple phone call. President Obama knew that his last-minute decision would impact the livelihoods of thousands in my state. But he was clearly more concerned with appeasing far-left interest groups than helping the men and women who depend on this land for their very survival.\n\nNow Mr. President, I wish to be clear: in opposing the Bears Ears monument designation, I am in no way opposing the protection of lands that need to be protected. Indeed, there are many cultural sites in San Juan County that deserve special care, and I am committed to working with the President and with Congress to preserve these sacred sites.\n\nBut I believe it is both unlawful and undemocratic for any President to seize millions upon millions of acres of land through the Antiquities Act?a law that was meant to give the President only narrow authority to designate special landmarks, such as a unique natural arch or the site of old cliff dwellings.\n\nWe desperately need a more sensible approach to protecting public lands?an approach that adheres more closely to the original intent of the Antiquities Act. Under this bill, Presidents were to exercise their authority to designate only the smallest area necessary to protect objects of antiquity. Instead, past Presidents have abused their power under the Antiquities Act to seize entire swaths of land. In the case of Bears Ears, President Obama cited his authority under the Antiquities Act to lock away an entire quarter of San Juan County?an action that undermines local autonomy and clearly violates the spirit of the law.\n\nIn my view, land-use decisions should not be decreed by executive fiat; they should be made only through a collaborative process that involves those who actually live on the land and know how to manage it. For example, had President Obama workedwith rather than around Congress to protect public lands, Utah?s schoolchildren would be better off today.\n\nThat?s because there are more than 100,000 acres of school trust land that lie within the 1.3 million-acre Bears Ears Monument. The land is a significant source of revenue for schools across our state, providing children with the instruction and resources they need to succeed well into adulthood. But with President Obama?s unilateral monument designation, this land was effectively rendered useless, eroding our state?s ability to raise much-needed funding for Utah?s schools. Had a more responsible legislative approach been taken to protect the Bears Ears, we could have preserved our school trust lands and protected the revenue they generate to benefit Utah?s schoolchildren.\n\nMr. President, I wish to emphasize again that I am fully committed to protecting the vast stretches of red rock, desert, and rolling prairie that dot our Western landscape. But the Antiquities Act is simply not the means to that end. Monumental land-use decisions affecting thousands of westerners should be made by the men and women on the ground and their duly elected representatives?not just the President and his advisers.\n\nCongress?not the President alone?should have a say in decisions that restrict access to millions of acres of federally owned land. In making such decisions, the voice of the people is paramount.\n\nThat?s why last week I visited the people of San Juan County. There, I spoke with Native Americans who rely upon this land and its resources for their very livelihood. I met with members of the San Juan County School District who depend on the school trust lands to keep their classrooms lit and their schools up and running. And I met with members of the San Juan County Commission who are dealing firsthand with the negative consequences of the Bears Ears designation.\n\nI traveled to San Juan County to listen to the people who feel abandoned by their very own government. My trip only reaffirmed my concern with the Bears Ears National Monument, which I have long held is not in the best interest of San Juan County. The men and women of San Juan County are a strong and hardy people. They share a deep connection and history with the land. But San Juan County isn?t without its struggles. For decades, it?s been listed among the most persistently poor counties in the nation.\n\nWith the vast majority of the land owned and operated by the federal government, the fate of San Juan County rests almost entirely with Beltway bureaucrats making politically motivated decisions more than two thousand miles away. The families of southern Utah should not be at the mercy of a federal bureaucracy so completely out of touch with the Western way of life.\n\nMr. President, enough is enough. Under the Constitution, Congress has the sole authority to manage public lands. The only reason the executive branch has any say in the management of federal lands is because Congress granted the President limited authority to participate in this process. We entrusted the executive branch to exercise reasonable authority through bills such as the Federal Lands Policy Management Act. At the heart of these policies was the principle of multiple-use and sustainable yield?a mandate that Congress gave the executive branch when granting it this authority.\n\nThe mandate of multiple-use was meant to preserve the ability of areas like San Juan County to live and grow, even when inundated with federally owned public lands. But President Obama betrayed this mandate through his Bears Ears designation when he declared much more than the smallest acreage possible as required by the Antiquities Act.\n\nWhen I spoke with the leadership of the San Juan County School District, they told me how prosperous the County had been when they were able to strike a balance with multiple land use. But the county?s schools have been strapped for cash ever since the Bears Ears Monument designation rendered these lands useless.\n\nAfter speaking with school officials, we then met with local County commissioners and Navajo from San Juan County and drove together into the heart of Bears Ears. At Bears Ears Meadow, we discussed how the monument could be altered so that the lands that deserve protection can remain protected but in a way that\'s consistent with the language of the Antiquities Act.\n\nMr. President, I believe there will be changes made to Bears Ears. These beautiful lands deserve protection, but so, too, do the people of San Juan County. They should not be trampled on by their own government. As long as I\'m a United States Senator, I will not stop fighting to make sure that Utahns have a voice in the management of public lands.\n\nFor years, I?ve fought to check the abuse of executive power under the Antiquities Act. That?s why I?ve been working closely with the Trump administration from day one to right the wrongs of previous administrations.\n\nIn the opening weeks of his presidency, I met personally with President Trump in the Oval Office to discuss the national monument issue at length. He listened intently as I relayed the fears and frustrations of thousands in our state who have been personally hurt by the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase monument designations. I explained the urgency of addressing the harm caused by these devastating measures, and I asked for his help in doing so.\n\nI was encouraged that?unlike his predecessor?President Trump actually took the time to listen and understand the heavy toll of such overreaching actions. Our President even assured me that he stands ready to work with us to undo the damage wrought by previous presidents under the Antiquities Act.\n\nAs details emerge, I understand that the President even stands ready to issue an Executive Order reining in the abuse of authority under the Antiquities Act. This action would direct the Department of the Interior ?to review prior monument designations and suggest legislative changes or modifications to [these] proclamations.?\n\nIn President Trump, we have a leader who is committed to defending the Western way of life. I am deeply grateful for his willingness to work with us to undo the harm caused by the overreach of his predecessors.\n\nIn protecting our public lands, I look forward to working with the Trump administration to establish a new precedent of collaboration and trust between states and the federal government.\n\nI yield the floor.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.',NULL,NULL),(49,'http://www.sltrib.com/news/5200833-155/developer-terry-diehl-may-be-bankrupt','Salt Lake Tribune','2017-04-23 12:54:11.000000','2017-04-25 12:33:27.000000','Developer Terry Diehl may be bankrupt and facing charges, but it looks like a pretty good life','[u\'Jennifer Dobner And Tom Harvey The Salt Lake Tribune\', u\'Jennifer Dobner\', u\'Tom Harvey\']','jones million life good bankrupt draper charges bankruptcy diehl hughes facing board uta looks pretty terry diehls developer','\"Mr. Diehl is not the developer on the project but rather his involvement has been due to his position on the UTA board of directors,\" Stenquist wrote.\nMoreover, Jones and Diehl had worked together when Jones was a Cottonwood Heights councilman supporting the developer\'s controversial Tavaci project in that city.\n—Cliff\'s edge • Orrin Colby Jr., who served with Diehl on the UTA board, was more generous with his impressions, noting Diehl\'s smarts and large, fun-loving personality.\nBradley recalled his discomfort with Diehl in the 1990s when the county bought the South Mountain Golf Course from Diehl.\nCurtis, Diehl and Hughes all were involved in site-selection decisions for the train station in Draper back in 2008 and 2009.','At 61, Diehl could the name be more apt? has been behind some of the biggest real estate deals along the Wasatch Front and helped shape Utah\'s award-winning public transit system, while weathering countless civil lawsuits, rumors about having politicians in his back pocket and two scathing legislative audits that, in part, challenged his role in more than one multimillion-dollar land deal surrounding UTA transit-station developments.\n\nNow, those same land transactions may be Diehl\'s undoing.\n\nOn April 5, a federal grand jury indicted Diehl on 12 criminal counts related to his 2012 bankruptcy, renewing old allegations that he may have misappropriated funds from business deals and used insider information from UTA to influence decisions and enrich himself.\n\nThe indictment followed on the heels of an announcement that Utah\'s U.S. attorney\'s office had struck an immunity deal with UTA in exchange for the agency\'s cooperation in an ongoing investigation into current and former UTA officials and others involving property purchases and developments around transit stations.\n\nThe charges allege that Diehl falsely reported his income or concealed assets ? including more than $1 million from the sale of land interests near the Draper FrontRunner station ? that should have been disclosed to the bankruptcy court.\n\nDiehl maintained his innocence in a text message to The Salt Lake Tribune on the day the indictment was made public.\n\n\"I obviously disagree with the government regarding the details involved with my bankruptcy,\" he wrote. \"I look forward to proving my innocence and having my day in court.\"\n\n?\n\nMum\'s the word ?

There are better sources.\"\n\nActually, Jones worked closely with Diehl for years when Jones was in charge not just of UTA legal affairs but also oversaw developments at train stations as Diehl and others bought properties and moved forward with construction of housing, retail stores and offices. Moreover, Jones and Diehl had worked together when Jones was a Cottonwood Heights councilman supporting the developer\'s controversial Tavaci project in that city.\n\nUtah House Speaker Greg Hughes, R-Draper, who in the past has publicly acknowledged his tight friendship with Diehl, also has gone silent. Through a spokesman, Hughes declined to comment, pointing The Tribune to a statement issued by his attorney the day Diehl\'s indictment was handed up. In it, attorney Brett Parkinson said Hughes \"has offered and continues to offer his assistance\" to federal authorities, and \"out of respect for their investigation, we cannot comment further.\"\n\nThere\'s a reason no one wants to speak publicly about Diehl, says Claire Geddes. \"They are scared of him.\"\n\nA longtime government watchdog who fought UTA on the Draper station and battled Diehl over the Big Cottonwood Canyon-area Tavaci development, Geddes said she, too, had to be careful.\n\n\"I\'m only saying things that are already public,\" said Geddes. \"I don\'t want to get sued.\"\n\n?\n\nCliff\'s edge ? Orrin Colby Jr., who served with Diehl on the UTA board, was more generous with his impressions, noting Diehl\'s smarts and large, fun-loving personality.\n\n\"He enjoys having people around him, particularly well-connected people,\" Colby said.\n\nHe also \"lived high\" on what appeared to be ample assets, Colby said, but was known for his generosity to others and his risk-taking nature.\n\nColby also said that trying to characterize Diehl reminded him of an anecdote about interviewing stagecoach drivers in the Old West. The critical question: whether the applicant might drive his rig within 6 inches of the cliff, or stay far away.\n\n\"Terry is more of a 6-incher,\" Colby said.\n\nSalt Lake County Councilman Jim Bradley said Diehl is not unlike others who seek the county\'s blessing on big development projects.\n\n\"He was usually asking for things that were totally out of a sense of appropriateness,\" Bradley said, \"and also always had some cloud of misdoing around him.\"\n\nBradley recalled his discomfort with Diehl in the 1990s when the county bought the South Mountain Golf Course from Diehl.\n\n\"I thought the county was disadvantaged in terms of transactions out there,\" said Bradley. \"I can\'t remember the details, but it was a fast one, like all his things are.\"\n\nThe county paid much more than was reasonable, according to an audit, and the deal ended on a sour note, Bradley said.\n\n\"They didn\'t sell the golf carts to us,\" Bradley said. \"We had to go back and spend several hundred thousand dollars to buy the golf carts. It was just crap like that.\"\n\nGeddes said Diehl and his projects have long benefited from having friends in high places. Hughes, for example, served on the UTA board with Diehl and showed up at the developer\'s side for a Tavaci-related Cottonwood Heights City Council meeting, where Diehl also had the support of Jones, a councilman.\n\n\"He\'s a very well-connected developer who is able to do a lot of things that most people wouldn\'t be able to do,\" she said.\n\nThere\'s also been a widely held perception that Diehl benefited through the years from his close relationship with the late Salt Lake County Councilman Randy Horiuchi, who lived in Diehl\'s well-appointed 9,200-square foot home for a while following a divorce.\n\nAt a 2013 council meeting, Horiuchi spoke in favor of the Tavaci development as he chastised environmentalists for their opposition and their criticism of his friendship with Diehl. He even complained of being photographed by activists at Diehl\'s house before unapologetically voting for the project ? albeit on the losing side.\n\nThe two were \"very, very close,\" Bradley said.\n\n?\n\nUTA deals ? First appointed to the UTA board in 2001, Diehl is said to have cultivated support not only from Hughes but also from former House Speaker Greg Curtis, a Sandy Republican who later became a UTA lobbyist. Curtis, Diehl and Hughes all were involved in site-selection decisions for the train station in Draper back in 2008 and 2009.\n\nAt the time, Diehl was not only a UTA board member but half-owner of a company that held an interest in the property adjacent to the planned FrontRunner site ? a fact that came to light later, through a civil lawsuit filing and a 2010 legislative audit, which concluded Diehl may have violated Utah\'s law concerning the misuse of insider information and made in the neighborhood of $20 million on the deal.\n\nAuditors in a subsequent investigation in 2014 criticized UTA\'s sweetheart deals, extravagant pay and bonuses and found that UTA was acting like a bank for developers, including $10 million that was paid in December 2010 to one-time Diehl partner Jeff Vitek for a parking garage at a time when there were no plans to build one.\n\nBetween the two probes, Diehl resigned from the UTA board in 2011 amid lingering conflict-of-interest allegations but not before Hughes and the rest of the trustees granted him a waiver from normal rules banning former board members from doing business with the agency for one year. Within months, he was back at UTA headquarters looking for business. Then, on March 30, 2012, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, listing $3.58 million in assets and $47.5 million in liabilities.\n\n?\n\nBroke, not busted ? Included among Diehl\'s detailed assets: His five-bedroom, six-bath with separate guest quarters and private office Cottonwood Heights home listed at $2.3 million ? although it is currently on the market at a \"huge discount\" of $3.95 million ? $1.1 million condo on Coronado Island, Calif., along with a Cadillac Escalade worth $40,000, a Mercedes worth $20,270, 80 bottles of wine valued at $5,000 and a Glen Wild County Club membership of $87,000.\n\nOn paper, it seems like an enviable life.\n\nBut court filings show Diehl\'s homes and vehicles were encumbered with debt and say he owed more than $35 million to financial institutions and his former business partner, Michael Bodell.\n\nThe bankruptcy appears to have been triggered by a bank\'s move to foreclose on Diehl\'s home. But documents filed in the case show Diehl did not appear to be slowing his spending as the bankruptcy loomed.\n\nBeginning on Feb. 19, 2012, Diehl charged $11,907.27 on a Diners Club credit card, purchasing plane tickets on two Philippines-based airline carriers in March and charging a March 19 payment for services at a plastic surgery clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, along with a string of other purchases, including multiple payments to Western Union, the documents show.\n\nDiehl also owed $450,000 to casinos, $300,000 of that to the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.\n\nMGM\'s claim says that Diehl drew four checks from the casino all on the same day ? March 28, two days before the bankruptcy filing. In addition, he owed $150,000 to the Aria casino, although the date he incurred that debt isn\'t stated.\n\nFederal prosecutors contend that Diehl lied about his gross income during the two years leading up to the bankruptcy, claiming an income of just $376,708.83.\n\n\"In truth and fact, defendant Diehl received over $1 million in gross income from the operation of his business involving real property stemming from a UTA FrontRunner transit oriented development at 12800 South in Draper beginning in 2008,\" the charges state.\n\n?\n\nThe other side? ? Draper resident Joan Little acknowledges she raised a glass of wine or two when she heard that Diehl had been indicted.\n\nThe former head of the South Mountain Homeowners Association was among residents who complained to her city\'s council about Diehl at the time of the train station planning. In an email ? subject line: \"Who owns Draper City\" ? Little challenged the council\'s support for the transit development project and the changes being made to city ordinances, all of which benefited Diehl.\n\nLittle said she spoke up after watching Diehl essentially direct the rewriting of the municipal code by the city manager and staff during a November 2008 meeting.\n\n\"Why would he be dictating a city code?\" she said, adding that she understood Diehl to be the developer in line for the project. \"That\'s why I questioned, why would the developer be involved?\"\n\nIn the email, which she provided to The Tribune, Little asked the city to hold off on voting to approve changes to city code and a developer agreement, which she said would \"saddle Draper citizens with millions $20+ million and counting of dollars of infrastructure costs that will benefit only the developer Terry Diehl.\"\n\nIn a response, Councilman Jeff Stenquist called Little \"grossly misinformed.\"\n\n\"Mr. Diehl is not the developer on the project but rather his involvement has been due to his position on the UTA board of directors,\" Stenquist wrote.\n\nColby, who was the vice chairman of UTA\'s board when the Draper station deals were inked in 2009, said questions about Diehl\'s alleged maneuvering on the Draper project were raised as he was leaving the board.\n\n\"I never took an opportunity to personally confront him about this,\" Colby said, adding that he \"never once felt like Terry told me a lie.\"\n\nIn fact, his bent for pushing the envelope and thinking outside the box was often good for the board, Colby said, because he prompted questions and discussion that helped trustees see possibilities that were not otherwise obvious,\n\nThat Diehl filed bankruptcy isn\'t too troubling, Colby said, because many of developers have been tossed around on the boom-and-bust waves of real estate.\n\nHe also said he\'s reserving judgment about the criminal charges brought by federal prosecutors.\n\n\"I\'ve been close enough to legal matters in my career that I\'ve learned charges are easy to come by,\" he said. \"There is always another side to the story, and I don\'t think we\'ve heard that yet.\"\n\n?

Greg Hughes, R-Draper, on the appointed UTA board. Hughes also favored that site.\n\nThen there was the time Diehl and Hughes tag-teamed to derail a UTA financial adviser they blamed for the defeat of another member of their clique, former Rep. Mark Walker, R-Sandy, who was running for state treasurer in 2008.\n\nWalker was endorsed by most of his House colleagues for the GOP nomination, but his campaign came under a cloud. Carl Empey, whom he had worked with at Zions Bank, publicly asserted that Walker had asked him to approach the other Republican candidate, Deputy Treasurer Richard Ellis, about a scheme in which Ellis would drop out of the race. In return, Walker, when elected, would retain Ellis in his job and give him a raise.\n\nEllis eventually filed an ethics complaint against Walker with the Utah lieutenant governor\'s office. Ellis prevailed in the GOP primary and the general election.\n\nWhen Empey, a public finance expert for Zions Bank and a longtime bond adviser for UTA, was testifying before the agency\'s board, Hughes questioned his legitimacy as an adviser.

Clinton had named the nearly 1.9 million-acre Grand Staircase in September 1996.\n\nMany of Utah\'s top federal and state officials have called for a rescission ? or at least a resizing ? of the Grand Staircase and Bears Ears monuments.\n\nWhile no president has attempted to withdraw a monument named by a predecessor, there have been those who have scaled back those designations.\n\nFor his part, Sen.

In it, attorney Brett Parkinson said Hughes \"has offered and continues to offer his assistance\" to federal authorities, and \"out of respect for their investigation, we cannot comment further.\"\n\nThere\'s a reason no one wants to speak publicly about Diehl, says Claire Geddes. \"They are scared of him.\"\n\nA longtime government watchdog who fought UTA on the Draper station and battled Diehl over the Big Cottonwood Canyon-area Tavaci development, Geddes said she, too, had to be careful.\n\n\"I\'m only saying things that are already public,\" said Geddes. \"I don\'t want to get sued.\"\n\n?\n\nCliff\'s edge ? Orrin Colby Jr., who served with Diehl on the UTA board, was more generous with his impressions, noting Diehl\'s smarts and large, fun-loving personality.\n\n\"He enjoys having people around him, particularly well-connected people,\" Colby said.\n\nHe also \"lived high\" on what appeared to be ample assets, Colby said, but was known for his generosity to others and his risk-taking nature.\n\nColby also said that trying to characterize Diehl reminded him of an anecdote about interviewing stagecoach drivers in the Old West. The critical question: whether the applicant might drive his rig within 6 inches of the cliff, or stay far away.\n\n\"Terry is more of a 6-incher,\" Colby said.\n\nSalt Lake County Councilman Jim Bradley said Diehl is not unlike others who seek the county\'s blessing on big development projects.\n\n\"He was usually asking for things that were totally out of a sense of appropriateness,\" Bradley said, \"and also always had some cloud of misdoing around him.\"\n\nBradley recalled his discomfort with Diehl in the 1990s when the county bought the South Mountain Golf Course from Diehl.\n\n\"I thought the county was disadvantaged in terms of transactions out there,\" said Bradley. \"I can\'t remember the details, but it was a fast one, like all his things are.\"\n\nThe county paid much more than was reasonable, according to an audit, and the deal ended on a sour note, Bradley said.\n\n\"They didn\'t sell the golf carts to us,\" Bradley said. \"We had to go back and spend several hundred thousand dollars to buy the golf carts. It was just crap like that.\"\n\nGeddes said Diehl and his projects have long benefited from having friends in high places. Hughes, for example, served on the UTA board with Diehl and showed up at the developer\'s side for a Tavaci-related Cottonwood Heights City Council meeting, where Diehl also had the support of Jones, a councilman.\n\n\"He\'s a very well-connected developer who is able to do a lot of things that most people wouldn\'t be able to do,\" she said.\n\nThere\'s also been a widely held perception that Diehl benefited through the years from his close relationship with the late Salt Lake County Councilman Randy Horiuchi, who lived in Diehl\'s well-appointed 9,200-square foot home for a while following a divorce.\n\nAt a 2013 council meeting, Horiuchi spoke in favor of the Tavaci development as he chastised environmentalists for their opposition and their criticism of his friendship with Diehl. He even complained of being photographed by activists at Diehl\'s house before unapologetically voting for the project ? albeit on the losing side.\n\nThe two were \"very, very close,\" Bradley said.\n\n?\n\nUTA deals ? First appointed to the UTA board in 2001, Diehl is said to have cultivated support not only from Hughes but also from former House Speaker Greg Curtis, a Sandy Republican who later became a UTA lobbyist. Curtis, Diehl and Hughes all were involved in site-selection decisions for the train station in Draper back in 2008 and 2009.\n\nAt the time, Diehl was not only a UTA board member but half-owner of a company that held an interest in the property adjacent to the planned FrontRunner site ? a fact that came to light later, through a civil lawsuit filing and a 2010 legislative audit, which concluded Diehl may have violated Utah\'s law concerning the misuse of insider information and made in the neighborhood of $20 million on the deal.\n\nAuditors in a subsequent investigation in 2014 criticized UTA\'s sweetheart deals, extravagant pay and bonuses and found that UTA was acting like a bank for developers, including $10 million that was paid in December 2010 to one-time Diehl partner Jeff Vitek for a parking garage at a time when there were no plans to build one.\n\nBetween the two probes, Diehl resigned from the UTA board in 2011 amid lingering conflict-of-interest allegations but not before Hughes and the rest of the trustees granted him a waiver from normal rules banning former board members from doing business with the agency for one year. Within months, he was back at UTA headquarters looking for business. Then, on March 30, 2012, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, listing $3.58 million in assets and $47.5 million in liabilities.\n\n?\n\nBroke, not busted ? Included among Diehl\'s detailed assets: His five-bedroom, six-bath with separate guest quarters and private office Cottonwood Heights home listed at $2.3 million ? although it is currently on the market at a \"huge discount\" of $3.95 million ? $1.1 million condo on Coronado Island, Calif., along with a Cadillac Escalade worth $40,000, a Mercedes worth $20,270, 80 bottles of wine valued at $5,000 and a Glen Wild County Club membership of $87,000.\n\nOn paper, it seems like an enviable life.\n\nBut court filings show Diehl\'s homes and vehicles were encumbered with debt and say he owed more than $35 million to financial institutions and his former business partner, Michael Bodell.\n\nThe bankruptcy appears to have been triggered by a bank\'s move to foreclose on Diehl\'s home. But documents filed in the case show Diehl did not appear to be slowing his spending as the bankruptcy loomed.\n\nBeginning on Feb. 19, 2012, Diehl charged $11,907.27 on a Diners Club credit card, purchasing plane tickets on two Philippines-based airline carriers in March and charging a March 19 payment for services at a plastic surgery clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, along with a string of other purchases, including multiple payments to Western Union, the documents show.\n\nDiehl also owed $450,000 to casinos, $300,000 of that to the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.\n\nMGM\'s claim says that Diehl drew four checks from the casino all on the same day ? March 28, two days before the bankruptcy filing. In addition, he owed $150,000 to the Aria casino, although the date he incurred that debt isn\'t stated.\n\nFederal prosecutors contend that Diehl lied about his gross income during the two years leading up to the bankruptcy, claiming an income of just $376,708.83.\n\n\"In truth and fact, defendant Diehl received over $1 million in gross income from the operation of his business involving real property stemming from a UTA FrontRunner transit oriented development at 12800 South in Draper beginning in 2008,\" the charges state.\n\n?\n\nThe other side? ? Draper resident Joan Little acknowledges she raised a glass of wine or two when she heard that Diehl had been indicted.\n\nThe former head of the South Mountain Homeowners Association was among residents who complained to her city\'s council about Diehl at the time of the train station planning. In an email ? subject line: \"Who owns Draper City\" ? Little challenged the council\'s support for the transit development project and the changes being made to city ordinances, all of which benefited Diehl.\n\nLittle said she spoke up after watching Diehl essentially direct the rewriting of the municipal code by the city manager and staff during a November 2008 meeting.\n\n\"Why would he be dictating a city code?\" she said, adding that she understood Diehl to be the developer in line for the project. \"That\'s why I questioned, why would the developer be involved?\"\n\nIn the email, which she provided to The Tribune, Little asked the city to hold off on voting to approve changes to city code and a developer agreement, which she said would \"saddle Draper citizens with millions $20+ million and counting of dollars of infrastructure costs that will benefit only the developer Terry Diehl.\"\n\nIn a response, Councilman Jeff Stenquist called Little \"grossly misinformed.\"\n\n\"Mr. Diehl is not the developer on the project but rather his involvement has been due to his position on the UTA board of directors,\" Stenquist wrote.\n\nColby, who was the vice chairman of UTA\'s board when the Draper station deals were inked in 2009, said questions about Diehl\'s alleged maneuvering on the Draper project were raised as he was leaving the board.\n\n\"I never took an opportunity to personally confront him about this,\" Colby said, adding that he \"never once felt like Terry told me a lie.\"\n\nIn fact, his bent for pushing the envelope and thinking outside the box was often good for the board, Colby said, because he prompted questions and discussion that helped trustees see possibilities that were not otherwise obvious,\n\nThat Diehl filed bankruptcy isn\'t too troubling, Colby said, because many of developers have been tossed around on the boom-and-bust waves of real estate.\n\nHe also said he\'s reserving judgment about the criminal charges brought by federal prosecutors.\n\n\"I\'ve been close enough to legal matters in my career that I\'ve learned charges are easy to come by,\" he said. \"There is always another side to the story, and I don\'t think we\'ve heard that yet.\"\n\n?

They, too, had balked at the station\'s location.\n\nTheir terminations outraged archaeologists nationwide, who said Herbert had weakened state oversight of historic treasures.\n\nThe ousters of Cuch, Rood, Kopp and Jones inspired Clark to come out publicly, alleging that he was fired two years earlier as managing director for business growth in the Governor\'s Office of Economic Development for getting in the way of the same proposed Front?Runner site.\n\nHe said it was because former House Speaker Greg Curtis, R-Sandy, who later became a lobbyist for UTA, favored that site.\n\nA state audit later referenced troubling agreements between UTA and a developer who was paid millions without delivering on his end of the bargain.\n\nThat developer had business ties to Diehl and bought development rights from him around a second Draper FrontRunner site, while Diehl was a friend and colleague of Rep. Greg Hughes, R-Draper, on the appointed UTA board. Hughes also favored that site.\n\nThen there was the time Diehl and Hughes tag-teamed to derail a UTA financial adviser they blamed for the defeat of another member of their clique, former Rep. Mark Walker, R-Sandy, who was running for state treasurer in 2008.\n\nWalker was endorsed by most of his House colleagues for the GOP nomination, but his campaign came under a cloud. Carl Empey, whom he had worked with at Zions Bank, publicly asserted that Walker had asked him to approach the other Republican candidate, Deputy Treasurer Richard Ellis, about a scheme in which Ellis would drop out of the race. In return, Walker, when elected, would retain Ellis in his job and give him a raise.\n\nEllis eventually filed an ethics complaint against Walker with the Utah lieutenant governor\'s office. Ellis prevailed in the GOP primary and the general election.\n\nWhen Empey, a public finance expert for Zions Bank and a longtime bond adviser for UTA, was testifying before the agency\'s board, Hughes questioned his legitimacy as an adviser. Diehl jumped in and questioned why Zions Bank was the only bond adviser and wondered whether other bids should be considered.\n\nEmpey eventually was forced to leave Zions Bank.\n\nIn November 2003, Diehl and his girlfriend left a downtown Salt Lake City bar in separate cars to drive to Diehl\'s home at the mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon.',NULL,NULL),(56,'http://www.sltrib.com/news/5209914-155/trump-to-order-review-of-bears','Salt Lake Tribune','2017-04-25 11:12:30.000000','2017-04-25 12:35:15.000000','Trump to order review of Bears Ears, Grand Staircase','[u\'The Salt Lake Tribune\', u\'Thomas Burr\']','trump staircase look bears review monument national grand interior president order ears','Many of Utah\'s top federal and state officials have called for a rescission — or at least a resizing — of the Grand Staircase and Bears Ears monuments.\nUtah\'s federal and state leaders had been pushing a legislative solution to shield the Bears Ears and other areas.\nFor his part, Sen.

Clinton had named the nearly 1.9 million-acre Grand Staircase in September 1996.\n\nMany of Utah\'s top federal and state officials have called for a rescission ? or at least a resizing ? of the Grand Staircase and Bears Ears monuments.\n\nWhile no president has attempted to withdraw a monument named by a predecessor, there have been those who have scaled back those designations.\n\nFor his part, Sen.

This has been the case since the founding of the Mormon faith in Utah, over 150 years ago.\n\n-- But in recent times you can add the names of Huntsman and Miller.\n\nThe Huntsmans have given more than $1 billion to cancer research, and raised another $1 billion for the Huntsman Cancer Institute the research center and the Huntsman Cancer Hospital the treatment facility, all built above the U. of U. hospital and related facilities high on a hill overlooking the valley.\n\n-- And the family of the late Larry H. Miller, led by wife Gail Miller, have through a special trust basically given the people of Utah the Jazz, the NBA franchise here, and the team?s arena in downtown Salt Lake City.\n\nWhen Huntsman Sr. controlled the chemical empire he was reported by Forbes as the richest man in Utah.\n\nNow, with the divestiture of the firm?s stock to sons and daughters and to the cancer-fighting foundation, Huntsman?s wealth is smaller.\n\nAnd into that wealth void steps Gail Miller, recently listed as the richest person in Utah.\n\nThese days, you take on any of these three institutions ? and the people who run them ? at your own risk.\n\nYou may have noticed that no political leaders, including Gov. Gary Herbert, are stepping into the fray trying to mediate this mess.\n\nHuntsman Sr. says it is a ?power grab? by the U. administration, trying to gain operational and financial control of the HCI and hospital, which he says are making money.\n\nWhile U. officials are remaining quiet, I?m hearing that they have for some time tried to rein in Dr. Beckerle, who reportedly was more interested in reporting back to Huntsman on her administration, rather than dealing with Lee, Pershing and other U. administrators.\n\nBut now personalities are involved, a dedicated director has lost her job, and the implications ? Pershing put off a Friday meeting where Huntsman officials were prepared to donate another $120 million to the institutions involved ? of real financial harm are immense.\n\nOfficially, Herbert has little power here ? he nominates folks to the Board of Regents, which oversees all of Utah?s colleges and university.\n\nPershing serves at the pleasure of the regents.\n\nMeanwhile, the U. of U. board of trustees, which oversees the U. itself, is stacked with other Utah business and big-money leaders ? recognize the names Price, Gardner, Eccles and Sorenson?\n\nAnd the U. has said that Beckerle?s dismissal was run past ?senior? members of the trustee board.\n\nThe chair of the trustee board is H. David Burton, who as head of the Mormon Church?s bishopric a few years back oversaw the building of the multi-billion-dollar City Creek Center and other important temporal relations with Salt Lake City and Utah state government.\n\nNow outside of the LDS Church?s hierarchy, he still carries a lot of water with the church leadership.\n\nBut Huntsman Sr. is the son-in-law of the late LDS Apostle David B. Haight, and served in one of the Quorums of the Seventy himself. And his connection to church leaders is also strong.\n\nIn short, in the Beckerle matter, if the pressure isn?t quickly relieved, and solutions found, there is the making of a political/media/U. of U. financial mess that could take years of work to rebuild ? if it could ever be so.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.',NULL,NULL),(58,'https://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/13020-poll-utahns-want-trump-to-change-or-undo-bears-ears','Utah Policy','2017-04-25 12:34:30.000000','2017-04-25 12:35:21.000000','Utahns want Trump to change or undo Bears Ears','[u\'Managing Editor\', u\'Bryan Schott\']','trump staircase grand bears monument undo say utahns president staircaseescalante change ears','Poll: Utahns want Trump to change or undo Bears EarsAs President Donald Trump readies an executive order to review the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments, a new poll shows Utahns favor reducing or rescinding at least one of those monuments.\nGary Herbert also says he\'s invited Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and President Trump to visit the Bears Ears monument.\nThat number includes 32% who say President Trump should \"definitely\" take action on Bears Ears.\n47% of Republicans say Trump should \"definitely\" take action on Bears Ears while 83% of Democrats say \"definitely not.\"\nSupport for undoing the Bears Ears monument has grown since Obama created the monument.','Poll: Utahns want Trump to change or undo Bears Ears\n\nAs President Donald Trump readies an executive order to review the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments, a new poll shows Utahns favor reducing or rescinding at least one of those monuments.\n\nThe UtahPolicy.com survey from Dan Jones & Associates finds a slim majority of Utahns 52% support either reducing the size of Bears Ears or doing away with the monument entirely.

There is no detail on how or when that will happen, something that needs to be fixed quickly, says Hughes.\n\nHughes ? who voted for SB54, which set up a signature-gathering route to a primary election ? says that a U.S. House vacancy should be filled along the lines of other state office openings ? the political party delegates of that specific geographic area should meet and send up names to the ballot or the governor.\n\nIn this case, names should be sent to the special election ballot by the delegates.\n\nThere would be no signature gathering, as provided for in SB54, says Hughes.\n\nThere simply is no time for all of that. Because of the 45-day federal law requirement for members of the military to get their ballots and vote, if you put down time for candidates to file, for the signature gathering process to take place, then a primary election, then another 45 days to the general election, it would take months before a U.S. House vacancy could be filled, said Hughes.\n\n?We need our Utah voice in the 3rd District way before then,? Hughes added.\n\nAnd if the party delegate process is good enough to fill a Utah attorney general or Utah legislative vacancy, then it is good enough for the U.S. House as well, he noted.\n\nOn the personal front, Tuesday morning Hughes and the House Chief of Staff Greg Hartley, who is also his personal political advisor, were off to Washington, D.C., to talk transportation ? and now the U.S. House 3rd District.\n\nHughes was considered for a top job in the U.S. Transportation Department. That may still be on the table.\n\nBut Hughes has been asked by Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao to consider being on a special DOT commission that would detail how President Donald Trump?s $1 trillion transportation infrastructure plan would be implemented.\n\nThis would not be a full-time job, but probably at least a monthly commitment of time, said Hughes.\n\nHughes, a former chair of the Utah Transit Authority, is a recognized expert on intermodal hubs and mass transit public/private partnerships.\n\nHughes says he would not out-of-hand reject any full-time job offer, but he doesn?t see it working with his young family and moving to Washington, D.C.\n\nHe added, concerning the 3rd District, that he doesn?t necessarily see his high-energy style of getting things done as a good fit in the 435-member U.S. House ? where junior members must wait years before moving up into positions of power ? even if his Republican Party keeps control of the House.\n\nBut a number of things are on the table, and first things first, said Hughes.\n\nAnd that is getting Herbert to call a special session so the GOP-controlled Legislature can put into place a special election law should Chaffetz resign his office.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.',NULL,NULL),(62,'https://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/13023-hatch-recaps-visit-to-bears-ears-praises-president-s-action-on-monuments','Utah Policy','2017-04-24 12:34:30.000000','2017-04-25 12:35:34.000000','Hatch recaps visit to Bears Ears, praises president\'s action on monuments','[u\'Press Release\']','recaps land praises san monuments bears presidents juan monument visit antiquities county lands hatch action president ears','Hatch recaps visit to Bears Ears, praises president\'s action on monumentsSenator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the senior Republican in the United States Senate, spoke on the Senate floor about his visit to the recently designated Bears Ears National Monument and the President’s forthcoming executive order, which will address past presidential abuses under the Antiquities Act.\nBut the county’s schools have been strapped for cash ever since the Bears Ears Monument designation rendered these lands useless.\nThat’s because there are more than 100,000 acres of school trust land that lie within the 1.3 million-acre Bears Ears Monument.\nI traveled to San Juan County to listen to the people who feel abandoned by their very own government.\nThat’s because the federal government administers the vast majority of San Juan County.','Hatch recaps visit to Bears Ears, praises president\'s action on monuments\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the senior Republican in the United States Senate, spoke on the Senate floor about his visit to the recently designated Bears Ears National Monument and the President?s forthcoming executive order, which will address past presidential abuses under the Antiquities Act.\n\nAs long as I\'m a United States Senator, I will not stop fighting to make sure that Utahns have a voice in the management of public lands. I understand that the President even stands ready to issue an Executive Order reining in the abuse of authority under the Antiquities Act. This action would direct the Department of the Interior ?to review prior monument designations and suggest legislative changes or modifications to [these] proclamations.? In President Trump, we have a leader who is committed to defending the Western way of life. I am deeply grateful for his willingness to work with us to undo the harm caused by the overreach of his predecessors.\n\nThe full speech, as prepared for delivery, is below:\n\nMr. President, last week, I had the opportunity to return home to visit the recently declared Bears Ears National Monument. This federal designation encompasses roughly 1.35 million acres in Utah and is located in one of our country?s most remote communities: San Juan County.\n\nFor decades, this quiet county remained largely untouched by the tensions of modern life and the taint of Washington politics. But no more. San Juan County is now the epicenter of a brutal battle over public lands?the outcome of which will have long-lasting consequences, not only for Utah but for the entire nation.\n\nIn geographical terms, San Juan County is massive. It?s the largest county in the State of Utah and the second-largest county in the United States. To put the size of San Juan County in perspective, consider that the county itself is larger than several states, including Connecticut, Delaware, and Rhode Island.\n\nSan Juan County alone accounts for nearly ten percent of all land in Utah. Yet Utahns have very little say in what actually goes on there. That?s because the federal government administers the vast majority of San Juan County. Incredibly, just eight percent of the county?s land is under private ownership while an area of more thantwo million acres is controlled by the Bureau of Land Management.\n\nThis means that, for years, my constituents, who depend on the land?s resources, have been at the mercy of out-of-touch bureaucrats who have little knowledge or personal connection to the land. President Obama only made matters worse when he spurned the men and women of San Juan County by declaring the Bears Ears National Monument last December. In doing so, he defied the will of the state legislature, the Governor, and the entire Utah Congressional delegation. President Obama?s midnight monument designation imposed even greater land-use restrictions on a region that is already predominantly controlled by the federal government.\n\nThis last-minute monument designation was a case study in presidential hubris. In making this unilateral decision, our former President either failed to heed the concerns of San Juan County residents or ignored them completely. As evidence of his disdain, President Obama issued this declaration with no open debate, no public hearing, and no vote in Congress. Utahns are now suffering the consequences of his recklessness.\n\nWhen I visited the Bears Ears region last week, I met with small business owners and local officials who lamented the fact that the Obama administration never even gave them the courtesy of a simple phone call. President Obama knew that his last-minute decision would impact the livelihoods of thousands in my state. But he was clearly more concerned with appeasing far-left interest groups than helping the men and women who depend on this land for their very survival.\n\nNow Mr. President, I wish to be clear: in opposing the Bears Ears monument designation, I am in no way opposing the protection of lands that need to be protected. Indeed, there are many cultural sites in San Juan County that deserve special care, and I am committed to working with the President and with Congress to preserve these sacred sites.\n\nBut I believe it is both unlawful and undemocratic for any President to seize millions upon millions of acres of land through the Antiquities Act?a law that was meant to give the President only narrow authority to designate special landmarks, such as a unique natural arch or the site of old cliff dwellings.\n\nWe desperately need a more sensible approach to protecting public lands?an approach that adheres more closely to the original intent of the Antiquities Act. Under this bill, Presidents were to exercise their authority to designate only the smallest area necessary to protect objects of antiquity. Instead, past Presidents have abused their power under the Antiquities Act to seize entire swaths of land. In the case of Bears Ears, President Obama cited his authority under the Antiquities Act to lock away an entire quarter of San Juan County?an action that undermines local autonomy and clearly violates the spirit of the law.\n\nIn my view, land-use decisions should not be decreed by executive fiat; they should be made only through a collaborative process that involves those who actually live on the land and know how to manage it. For example, had President Obama workedwith rather than around Congress to protect public lands, Utah?s schoolchildren would be better off today.\n\nThat?s because there are more than 100,000 acres of school trust land that lie within the 1.3 million-acre Bears Ears Monument. The land is a significant source of revenue for schools across our state, providing children with the instruction and resources they need to succeed well into adulthood. But with President Obama?s unilateral monument designation, this land was effectively rendered useless, eroding our state?s ability to raise much-needed funding for Utah?s schools. Had a more responsible legislative approach been taken to protect the Bears Ears, we could have preserved our school trust lands and protected the revenue they generate to benefit Utah?s schoolchildren.\n\nMr. President, I wish to emphasize again that I am fully committed to protecting the vast stretches of red rock, desert, and rolling prairie that dot our Western landscape. But the Antiquities Act is simply not the means to that end. Monumental land-use decisions affecting thousands of westerners should be made by the men and women on the ground and their duly elected representatives?not just the President and his advisers.\n\nCongress?not the President alone?should have a say in decisions that restrict access to millions of acres of federally owned land. In making such decisions, the voice of the people is paramount.\n\nThat?s why last week I visited the people of San Juan County. There, I spoke with Native Americans who rely upon this land and its resources for their very livelihood. I met with members of the San Juan County School District who depend on the school trust lands to keep their classrooms lit and their schools up and running. And I met with members of the San Juan County Commission who are dealing firsthand with the negative consequences of the Bears Ears designation.\n\nI traveled to San Juan County to listen to the people who feel abandoned by their very own government. My trip only reaffirmed my concern with the Bears Ears National Monument, which I have long held is not in the best interest of San Juan County. The men and women of San Juan County are a strong and hardy people. They share a deep connection and history with the land. But San Juan County isn?t without its struggles. For decades, it?s been listed among the most persistently poor counties in the nation.\n\nWith the vast majority of the land owned and operated by the federal government, the fate of San Juan County rests almost entirely with Beltway bureaucrats making politically motivated decisions more than two thousand miles away. The families of southern Utah should not be at the mercy of a federal bureaucracy so completely out of touch with the Western way of life.\n\nMr. President, enough is enough. Under the Constitution, Congress has the sole authority to manage public lands. The only reason the executive branch has any say in the management of federal lands is because Congress granted the President limited authority to participate in this process. We entrusted the executive branch to exercise reasonable authority through bills such as the Federal Lands Policy Management Act. At the heart of these policies was the principle of multiple-use and sustainable yield?a mandate that Congress gave the executive branch when granting it this authority.\n\nThe mandate of multiple-use was meant to preserve the ability of areas like San Juan County to live and grow, even when inundated with federally owned public lands. But President Obama betrayed this mandate through his Bears Ears designation when he declared much more than the smallest acreage possible as required by the Antiquities Act.\n\nWhen I spoke with the leadership of the San Juan County School District, they told me how prosperous the County had been when they were able to strike a balance with multiple land use. But the county?s schools have been strapped for cash ever since the Bears Ears Monument designation rendered these lands useless.\n\nAfter speaking with school officials, we then met with local County commissioners and Navajo from San Juan County and drove together into the heart of Bears Ears. At Bears Ears Meadow, we discussed how the monument could be altered so that the lands that deserve protection can remain protected but in a way that\'s consistent with the language of the Antiquities Act.\n\nMr. President, I believe there will be changes made to Bears Ears. These beautiful lands deserve protection, but so, too, do the people of San Juan County. They should not be trampled on by their own government. As long as I\'m a United States Senator, I will not stop fighting to make sure that Utahns have a voice in the management of public lands.\n\nFor years, I?ve fought to check the abuse of executive power under the Antiquities Act. That?s why I?ve been working closely with the Trump administration from day one to right the wrongs of previous administrations.\n\nIn the opening weeks of his presidency, I met personally with President Trump in the Oval Office to discuss the national monument issue at length. He listened intently as I relayed the fears and frustrations of thousands in our state who have been personally hurt by the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase monument designations. I explained the urgency of addressing the harm caused by these devastating measures, and I asked for his help in doing so.\n\nI was encouraged that?unlike his predecessor?President Trump actually took the time to listen and understand the heavy toll of such overreaching actions. Our President even assured me that he stands ready to work with us to undo the damage wrought by previous presidents under the Antiquities Act.\n\nAs details emerge, I understand that the President even stands ready to issue an Executive Order reining in the abuse of authority under the Antiquities Act. This action would direct the Department of the Interior ?to review prior monument designations and suggest legislative changes or modifications to [these] proclamations.?\n\nIn President Trump, we have a leader who is committed to defending the Western way of life. I am deeply grateful for his willingness to work with us to undo the harm caused by the overreach of his predecessors.\n\nIn protecting our public lands, I look forward to working with the Trump administration to establish a new precedent of collaboration and trust between states and the federal government.\n\nI yield the floor.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.',NULL,NULL),(63,'http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865678770/Audit-considered-amid-criticized-donation-to-University-of-Utah.html','Deseret News','2017-04-27 19:52:34.000000','2017-04-27 08:52:39.000000','Audit considered amid criticized donation to University of Utah','[u\'Ben Lockhart\']','audit legislative lee considered amid university soonshiong utah state criticized donation soonshiongs beckerle','It remained unclear Thursday whether Soon-Shiong\'s donation was a source of tension at the university between Lee and Beckerle.\nThe other $2 million of Soon-Shiong\'s donation were for non-research related costs at the university, according to Nelson.\nAsked about what role Lee may have played in ultimately accepting Soon-Shiong\'s donation, Kiefer said she wasn\'t privy to that information.\nFILE - House Speaker Greg Hughes speaks with the media during the final night of the legislature at the Utah State Capitol in Salt Lake City on Thursday, March 9, 2017.\n\'s senior vice president whom he severely criticized for firing Beckerle, for Lee\'s work in accepting his donation on behalf of the university.','FILE - House Speaker Greg Hughes speaks with the media during the final night of the legislature at the Utah State Capitol in Salt Lake City on Thursday, March 9, 2017. A large donation to the University of Utah has the attention of Hughes, who has asked the Office of the Legislative Auditor General to gather information to determine whether an audit into it is needed.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY ? A large donation to the University of Utah has caught the attention of Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes, who has asked the Office of the Legislative Auditor General to gather information to determine whether an audit is needed.\n\nThe donation in question is a $12 million gift from Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire physician whose charitable efforts were questioned for their ethics last month by STAT News, a health news site. The donation was made in September 2014.\n\nGreg Hartley, chief of staff for Hughes, confirmed that Hughes is worried about the appropriateness of that donation.\n\n\"He\'s asked legislative auditors to do some initial analysis and fact finding to see if an audit needs to happen,\" Hartley said.\n\nHughes is also worried about the sudden firing of Huntsman Cancer Institute CEO Mary Beckerle last week, according to Hartley. Beckerle was reinstated to her position Tuesday following an outcry from staff, multiple protests on campus and stinging criticisms of the university by the facility\'s namesake and founder, Jon Huntsman Sr.\n\nChris Nelson, communications director at the U., said the legislative audit staff has been in touch with university administrators this week about an \"audit survey,\" in which they will be collecting preliminary information about Soon-Shiong\'s donation.\n\nHe said administrators \"stand by the use of the donation\" and \"stand by receiving the donation.\"\n\n\"We wouldn\'t take a donation if we didn\'t think it was going to be an ethical part of our funds,\" Nelson said.\n\nHe added that the U. is happy to comply with any requests from auditors.\n\n\"We welcome the state Legislature doing this; we\'re a state entity,\" Nelson said.\n\nThe spokesman said he spoke with administrators and was unaware of any initial audit survey looking into Beckerle\'s firing.\n\nUtah State Auditor John Dougall said he has not so far received any information that would trigger an audit from his office, and he would refrain from conducting a duplicate inquiry if legislative auditors find enough to launch a more thorough probe of their own.\n\nThe STAT News story cited the large gift to the University of Utah as an example of Soon-Shiong donating money with hyper-specific stipulations allegedly ensuring that it funnels back through one of his own business enterprises.\n\nThe report quoted one tax lawyer who believes Soon-Shiong was \"laundering money through the University of Utah\" by making it unreasonably difficult for anyone other than NantHealth, which is owned by Soon-Shiong, to qualify for using the gifted funds to complete the genetic research study that was the stated purpose of the donation.\n\nThe story also cited other lawyers who said his practices are at least worth questioning.\n\nThe article prompted additional coverage from national magazines and from the L.A. Times, which quoted Soon-Shiong calling the STAT article \"maliciously false.\"\n\nHuntsman last week questioned the relationship between Soon-Shiong and Vivian Lee, the U.\'s senior vice president whom he severely criticized for firing Beckerle, for Lee\'s work in accepting his donation on behalf of the university.\n\n\"She\'s a very controversial person that clearly needs to be fired,\" Huntsman said of Lee at the time, though he later backed off of that demand after Beckerle was reinstated and an agreement was reached that she will no longer be required to report to Lee.\n\nJulie Kiefer, science communications manager for University of Utah Health Care, told the Deseret News that, to the best of her knowledge, a meeting between Lee and Soon-Shiong helped kickstart the philanthropist\'s donation to the U.\n\n\"There was an alumni from the university who was living in Southern California and knew Patrick Soon-Shiong. And Vivian Lee was out there for another reason and this alumni thought it might be useful to get these two together because they had similar interests,\" Kiefer said. \"So the introduction was made and they just kind of took off from there.\"\n\nAsked about what role Lee may have played in ultimately accepting Soon-Shiong\'s donation, Kiefer said she wasn\'t privy to that information.\n\n\"I don\'t know the specifics of that connection,\" she said.\n\nKiefer confirmed that NantHealth was the only organization that met the \"specific requirements\" stipulated in $10 million of Soon-Shiong\'s donation that she said was intended for a \"project to investigate genetic risk factors of about 25 different conditions.\"\n\n\"They were very high standards, very state of the art standards,\" Kiefer said. \"NantHealth facilities were the only facilities that could really meet the specifications within the turnaround time that they required for the project.\"\n\nKiefer said \"one or two other institutions\" would have qualified for the project, but were too backed up with other projects to complete the research in the requested time frame.\n\nThe other $2 million of Soon-Shiong\'s donation were for non-research related costs at the university, according to Nelson.\n\nKiefer lauded the accomplishments brought by the donation and indicated Soon-Shiong was straightforward in upholding his promise to the U.\n\n\"He made their commitments, fulfilled their commitments to the university,\" she said. \"Beyond that, the data we received was beyond our high expectations ? very good data.\"\n\nThe project carried out by NantHealth consisted of collecting \"1,000 genomes of people from Utah in an effort to understand the genetic basis of 25 different conditions,\" including autism, breast cancer and premature births. She said that in February, meaningful findings were released on one of those conditions ? premature ovarian insufficiency ? and that more findings stemming from the project are expected to be released soon.\n\nIt remained unclear Thursday whether Soon-Shiong\'s donation was a source of tension at the university between Lee and Beckerle. The U. has refused to say why Lee and U. President David Pershing fired Beckerle via email on April 17.\n\nKiefer said she was \"not aware of any concerns that were voiced\" at the U. at the time the donation was finalized and said the Huntsman Cancer Institute itself wasn\'t connected to the recruiting of Soon-Shiong\'s donation or directly affected by the study it funded.\n\n\"This is separate from the Huntsman Cancer Institute,\" she said.',NULL,NULL),(64,'https://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/13050-colbert-chaffetz-is-a-gutless-charles-schultz-rough-draft-with-video','Utah Policy','2017-04-27 20:52:34.000000','2017-04-27 08:52:49.000000','Chaffetz is a \'Gutless Charles Schultz rough draft\' (with video)','[u\'Managing Editor\', u\'Bryan Schott\']','schultz chaffetz jason information charles michael say general gutless cant video seen draft rough data flynn','The Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Jason Chaffetz, had what I would describe as a \'flaccid\' condemnation of Flynn\'s actions.\nRep.

Gary Herbert continues to have a high approval rating, a new UtahPolicy.com poll shows.\n\nPollster Dan Jones & Associates finds in a new survey that 64 percent of Utahns have a ?very? or ?somewhat? favorable opinion of the governor.\n\nOnly 32 percent have an unfavorable opinion of Herbert, now starting his 8th year in office.\n\nJust 4 percent have heard of Herbert, but have no opinion of him, and 1 percent have never heard of him.\n\nBack in December, Herbert favorables were 63-29 percent over his unfavorable.\n\nThese are numbers Sen. Orrin Hatch and the rest of Utah?s congressional delegation would love to have.\n\nBy comparison, in the same survey Hatch?s favorables are underwater ? 46 percent approve of him, while 48 percent disapprove.\n\nThe other delegation members are just over 50 percent favorables.\n\nStill, while Herbert leads the GOP pack we have no Democrats in statewide office or federal office, Utahns are not loving their governors today as they have in the past.\n\nBack in the 1990s and early 2000s, former Govs. Mike Leavitt, Olene Walker and Jon Huntsman Jr. saw favorability ratings in the 70th percentiles.\n\nClearly, Utahns are following the nation in not liking their top officeholders as they once did ? or are a more cynical lot as especially the federal government has been an overall disappointment.\n\nBut by the standards of governors in other states today, Herbert is well-liked.\n\nHowever, younger Utahns are not as enthralled with Herbert as are their parents and grandparents -- Jones finds:\n\n18-24 year olds give Herbert a 56-29 favorable rating.\n\n\n\n\n\n25-34 year olds have a 57-35 percent rating.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile those 65 years and older really like the governor, giving him a 73-25 percent favorable rating.\n\nHerbert has his detractors, especially among Democrats:\n\nMembers of the opposing party give Herbert a high unfavorable rating, 72 percent disapprove of him, only 22 percent like the Republican governor.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolitical independents are split, 52 percent approve, 42 percent disapprove.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile fellow Republicans love the governor, 84-13 percent.\n\nHe clearly has no problems among his own party members, which may give Herbert leeway in pushing for tax reform/tax hikes in the coming months.\n\nThere is an education/business group ?

INSERT INTO `News_committies` VALUES (1,'Administrative Rules Review Committee','\r\nThe Administrative Rules Review Committee was established by the Legislature in the 1983 General Session. Utah Code 63G-3-501(3)(b) requires the committee to review agency rules to ensure they do not exceed legislative authority and intent and to determine the rules\' impact on the economy, state and local government operations, and affected individuals.Initially, the committee primarily reviewed proposed agency rules, which are published twice monthly in the Utah State Bulletin by the Division of Administrative Rules. However, committee members expressed concern that existing rules, many of which were based on broad grants of statutory authority, had not been reviewed.In the 1988 General Session, an appropriation was provided for staff to review existing rules as a component of the Committee\'s review process. The Committee directed staff to prepare legislation that would delete the broad grants of rulemaking authority given to several state agencies, and to work with each affected agency to ensure the rewritten authorizing statutes would still provide needed specific rulemaking authority. The Committee recognized that this review process could require several years to complete.As part of an agreement between the Administrative Rules Review Committee and the governor, legislation passed during the 1989 General Session that granted the Committee authority to prepare annual legislation reauthorizing all state agency rules except rules specified in that year\'s bill. The Committee delayed action on broad statutory grants until after the 1990 General Session.From 1989 through 1994, the Committee examined the rules of every state agency. Agency representatives were provided with a detailed analysis of their rules and met with the Committee to consider future rule changes. This process prompted agencies to make more concise, carefully prepared rules consistent with Utah statutes.In the 2002 General Session, for the first time, the annual reauthorization legislation repealed written statements of state agencies that met the definition of a rule that had not proceeded through the required rulemaking process that includes notice, publication, and public comment. In the 2003 General Session, legislation passed clarifying that an agency\'s written statement conforming to the definition of a rule can only be enforced if it has gone through the statutorily required rulemaking process, including publication and public comment.The Committee meets regularly to address specific concerns raised by legislators and the public regarding existing and proposed state agency administrative rules. The Committee also performs an annual audit of state agency rulemaking to verify that state agencies have submitted rules to implement newly-passed legislation containing new rulemaking requirements. \n'),(2,'Business, Economic Development, and Labor Appropriations Subcommittee','\r\nThe Business Economic Development and Labor Appropriations Subcommittee considers budgets for departments related to businesses, employees, consumers, tourists, and others involved in the state\'s economy.The committee has legislative responsibility for 10 departments: Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, Department of Commerce, Department of Financial Institutions, Department of Insurance, Labor Commission, Public Service Commission, Department of Heritage and Arts, Governor\'s Office of Economic Development, USTAR, and Tax Commission.Issues addressed by the committee in recent years include restructuring the Department of Heritage and Arts and changing oversight and budgetary mechanisms for the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.\r\n'),(3,'Commission on Federalism','\r\nNot Provided\r\n'),(4,'Executive Appropriations Committee','\r\nThe Executive Appropriations Committee (EAC) serves as the \"hub\" committee for subcommittees of the Joint Appropriations Committee.
